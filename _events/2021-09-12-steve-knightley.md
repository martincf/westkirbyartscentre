We are very pleased to present Steve Knightley on his latest UK tour.

Pass Notes - The stories behind the songs

Following the success of last year’s intimate one man show, Steve’s latest outing is intended for anyone fascinated by the art and craft of song writing.

Exploring his extensive back catalogue and introducing unheard, new material he explores the themes and stories that inspire him and shows how music and words can become lyrics and chords and notes can meld to create songs that acquire a life of their own!
