An evening of comedy and music. Featuring...

## Comedians

### Jack Shanik

There’s a fine line between the sublime and the ridiculous. Jack Shanik has no idea where it is, but has fun finding out. One-liners walking the tightrope between daft and dafter.

> 'Superbly formulated and consistently funny one-liners' – Back Street Heroes magazine

> 'Left me wondering just what he was going to say next', 'Left me with an aching side' – Notts Comedy Review

> 'A host of inventive gags doused in wordplay and performed with aplomb' – Stagefright Comedy

### Daniel Triscott

Subtle, understated, and casually paced, Dan has a forensic approach in creating distinctly performed jokes. From off-beat one liners to short comedic ideas that range from satisfyingly thoughtful to the down right idiotic, there's no theme, no real opinions, no message, just sweet sweet comedy mechanics in action! And what more could you want than that?

> 'Impressed me muchly' - Janey Godley

> 'Absolutely excellent one-liners.' - The Stand, Newcastle

> 'A lot of laughter throughout this impressive set.' - Notts Comedy Review

### Carla Pol

Carla Pol moved from the italian Countryside to to Manchester to talk about rabbits, Italian people and the funny side of diversity.

### Rat kings

Liverpool based dark sketch duo consisting of Liam Hale and Sean Stoakes.

## Music

### Reid Anderson

A singer-songwriter from the North West coast of England. He delivers dark mesmerising sweeping sounds: lyrical vessels reminiscent of sea-shanties, traveller's songs and folk myth.

Reid’s music is Americana with a gothic influence. Traditional but with a modern twist; confidently and skilfully delivered. Memorable tunes and thoughtful lyrics - Liverpool Acoustic
