The concert will be performed by the WKAC’s house band, The Celebrated, in aid of the charity Tyddyn Môn who have been supporting adults with learning disabilities on the Isle of Anglesey for over 30 years. Their mission is to provide the best possible support, care and guidance to the people that they support so that they can live happy, full and independent lives.

The Celebrated have been performing concerts in aid of charities for the last 5 years, including several featuring the music of Nobel Laureate, Bob Dylan.

Back Pages will explore the lyrics of Dylan’s songs across decades of the bard’s creativity, arranged to suit The Celebrated’s own style and flair.  Dylan’s lyrics have multiple meanings for us to enjoy and reflect on our own humanity, through love, anguish, protest and nobility.

We invite you to join us on this exploratory concert knowing that you are supporting a wonderful charity.
