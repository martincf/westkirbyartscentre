Hailing from Bath, Isobel Holly is a 19-year-old singer-songwriter, whose exciting blend of
country, rock and soul makes for a truly captivating live performance. Influences such as
Fleetwood Mac and Aretha Franklin are reflected in her heartfelt song-writing and powerful
vocals.

This November, see her play live alongside her incredible band, all of whom study at the
Royal Northern College of Music. You'll have a taste of her debut upcoming album, which
is set for release in February next year. Expect intense guitar solo sections combined
with delicate lyricism.

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue.
