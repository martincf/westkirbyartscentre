After a busy first year spent self-producing and releasing their debut EP, 'Let's Play', Mountainface, headed into Penylan Studios in the summer of 2017 with producers Sebastian Allemand (Gallops, Heal The Last Stand) & Rod Callan (Ronnie Wood, Donovan) to lay down a studio EP.

'Dead Lake' was released April 20th, 2018 with a packed-out launch gig at Chester's Telfords Warehouse, which was then followed by a month spent gigging around Amsterdam, Berlin and further reaches of Europe.
Expressive and cavernous at its peak, 'Dead Lake' finds the trio contending with loss, memory and ultimately acceptance, in an effort to escape the depths of those long dark blues, touched upon by musical influences such as Nick Drake, Punch Brothers and Fleet Foxes.

Since their formation they've supported Eliza Carthy and The Wayward Band, This Is The Kit, Scott Matthews, Blair Dunlop, Urban Folk Quartet and Moore Moss Rutter; shared stages with Seth Lakeman, Jon Gomm, Merry Hell & Marcus Bonfanti and have had repeat performances at Focus Wales, Gorjys Secrets Festival, Cropredy Fringe and Folk On The Dock.
