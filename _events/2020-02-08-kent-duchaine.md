Kent returns after his sell out show last year. We are so pleased to have Kent back this year for what will be one of the highlights of our 2020 calendar.

> One of the best top five concerts nationwide (across ALL music genres)" -  SUNDAY TIMES COLOR SUPPLEMENT

> "Not only is Kent know as a well known master of the blues, his guitar playing is exceptional and his deep intriguing voice a great combination that really set the old style delta blues alight. DuChaine really has lived the blues life which is clearly evident in his music." -  THE ORCADIAN, ORKNEY BLUES FESTIVAL

Kent DuChaine has listened to, hung out with, opened up for, travelled and played with most
of the great Blues men and women his whole adult life. The list is too long to name them
all, but some of the major ones are:  Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, John Lee Hooker,
Big Mama Thornton, Koko Taylor, BB, Albert and Freddie King, Willie Dixon, Bukka White,
Johnny Shines, Robert JR Lockwood, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Furry Lewis and Son House.
These were the big Country and Urban Blues influences who Kent heard and/or played with.

Kent's early days with the Blues involved him both living and learning the Blues life.

Kent attended two of the early "Ann Arbor Blues Festivals" in the 70's. It united together
virtually every important Blues man and woman in the world who performed for the three days.

His dedication and talent for the blues earned him the honor of opening two shows for
Bukka White, spending time with Mississippi Fred McDowell and befriending his hometown
Bluesmen, Lazy Bill Lucas and Mojo Buford in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He has even hung out
with Muddy Waters who he later paid his last respects to at Muddys' funeral in Chicago.
You will have to wait till you see him on stage to hear if he took up Muddy's offer of
some reefer and  Champagne!

The Blues were happening all around Kent at this time and he ended up playing alongside
Kim Wilson in a band called "Aces, Straights & Shuffles". Willie Dixon heard the band and
complimented Kent on his slide playing sounding like a young Muddy Waters. Willie arranged
a recording contract for the boys to help them launch their career by putting them on stage
with Howlin' Wolf, John Lee Hooker, Albert Collins and Margie Evans.

Kent spent time in Austin, Texas in the mid 70's, soaking up the blues at "Antone's", who
where beginning to bring in alot of the old Blues men. He met Stevie Ray Vaughn and
learned that there where others who shared the same passion and respect for the real Blues.

Around this time the most incredible thing happened: after searching for ten years, Kent
found his beloved 1934 National Steel guitar, Leadbessie.

After some time, Kent could see that the solo Blues life was where he wanted to go.
Traveling the roads alone allowed him the opportunities he was seeking. Following the Blues
trails unhindered gave him the freedom to play where and when he wanted, for what ever he
could get, even if it was just a meal and a drink.  The solo life built his following,
reputation and talent for the real Blues.

By the late 80's he was doing 300+ shows a year all over N. America. He was blessed by the
Blues in 1988 by coming across the great Johnny Shines who was living in Alabama. Kent had
been based there already for seven years so he knew his way around. The two of them
together where a sight to see...." The Young and the Old". Kent and Johnny traveled for
three years and did over 200 shows together. He also recorded a W.C. Handy award winning
album with Johnny and Snooky Pryor.

Come and enjoy one of the great blues men still around but be sure to buy your tickets
early as this one will sell out!
