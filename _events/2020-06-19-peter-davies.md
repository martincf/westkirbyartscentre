> "Pete Davies is a great singer-songwriter!” The late, great, Vin Garbutt, – Teesside Troubadour

> Long Way Home "…disguises the iron fist of its messages in a velvet glove…” – FolkWords

> "Skilfully constructed songs presented with panache and passion – Pete Davies played a barnstorming gig at the Edinburgh Fringe!" – Paddy Bort, Edinburgh Fringe

> “North-eastern singer-songwriter Pete Davies has come up with a fine record of warm positivity. The anthem-like track ‘Miracles’ typifies this, but the mood of hopefulness and display of impressive musicianship pervades the whole collection.” Colin Bailey, – The Bailey Beat

>“…Pete Davies set the tone for the evening beautifully. He reminded me of that crop of singer songwriters like Peter Bond and Paul Metsers. He had the winning combination of an effective guitar style coupled with meaningful lyrics. I particularly liked ‘Is It Ever Going To Rain?’ and ‘Go On And Dance, Joanne’…” – The Derbyshire Times

> “I love his clear voice and thoughtful uplifting lyrics.” – Jan Hall, Folk Roots Radio, Ontario, Canada

> “The combination of care, and discipline shows in the quality of his songs and performance.” – Stainsby Festival

> “Pete's reputation as a performer and songwriter continues to grow.” – Middlesbrough Town Hall
