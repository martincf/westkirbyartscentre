REBECCA LOEBE MYSTERY PRIZE 2020 TOUR

Join Rebecca Loebe as she celebrates the 10-year anniversary of her breakthrough album “Mystery Prize.” On this intimate, acoustic concert tour she’ll re-visit songs and stories from the album that spent ten weeks on the Americana Top 40 chart and launched her international touring career with a European record deal and an invitation to appear on the first season of NBC’s “The Voice.”

Over the past decade, Rebecca has built a fervent, grass-roots following performing an average of 150 concerts per year in over 40 states of the US and 15 countries. Along the way, she’s released three more full-length studio albums which feature many collaborators and themes that can be traced back to her early work on Mystery Prize. As a writer, Rebecca has taken top honors in some of the songwriting world's most prestigious competitions including the Kerrville New Folk Songwriting contest. 

Come learn why Rolling Stone, Billboard Magazine, and NPR’s Mountain Stage have all recently raved about Rebecca.
