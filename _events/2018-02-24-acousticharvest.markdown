Canadian born singer, songwriter Neil Young released his fourth album Harvest in 1972. At that time he was considered the most successful singer/songwriter in the world.

His album ‘Harvest’ and the single ‘Heart Of Gold’ topped both the UK and US charts. This commercial breakthrough followed the earlier seminal ‘After The Gold Rush’ (his third studio album). These records represented the golden period of Young’s career.

Though still influential today, his music is defined by this brilliant acoustic period. Wirral musician and Neil Young authority, Dean Johnson will present his take on the solo classics of the Canadian troubadour, including Young's work with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and later anthems such as ‘Rockin’ In The Free World’.
