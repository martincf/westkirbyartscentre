The first part of the evening - Facing the Music (Rosie Glass) is an autobiographical story of Rosie's experiences after surviving a life threatening illness, interspersed with flute pieces recorded by her.

The story takes us through the irony of unexpectedly surviving only to be shown that as a suddenly "dis-abled person" she must often accept what others do not. The story ends with a vision for a changed future, while also including a varied musical programme.Â 

The second part of the evening - Comedy Songs (Spiky Feather Duo) will feature a selection of light hearted swipes at the mundane, the frustrating and the ridiculous. Meet demonic musical instruments, talking hexagons and reincarnated insurance salesmen, set to a background of classical (and not-so-classical) guitar and flute music.
