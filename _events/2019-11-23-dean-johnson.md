Following two spectacular 'album themed' celebrations Neil Young superfan Dean Johnson mines 50 years of the Canadian's Hits of Gold. This unique performance will be staged 'in the round' and totally acoustic reflecting the intimacy of Neil Young's early live shows, where the audience were so close they could almost touch the artist.  

It is the perfect environment to enjoy Neil's best loved songs and some surprises and
hidden gems.

30 years ago Dean staged the first ever tribute to folk rock's greatest maverick, and now 'there comes a time' for another. The 'up close' nature of this concert means seating is very  limited so early booking is advisable.

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs.Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
