A year after opening, Lightbox Darkroom – part of the West Kirby Arts Centre – will display a selection of darkroom members' black and white darkroom prints.

**Running for three weeks**, all prints are shot on film and developed using traditional hand printing techniques. A limited number of each print will be available for purchase. A price list is available at the exhibition.

If you'd like to visit the exhibition, the Arts Centre hall will be open from 10am to 5pm each day. Contact [Martin](mailto:info@lightbox.photo) if you're interested in the darkroom or would like to purchase a print.
