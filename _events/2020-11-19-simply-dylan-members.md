Join John O’Connell and his Simply Dylan band for an acoustic gig.

SIMPLY DYLAN is O'Connell's personal exploration and celebration of the rich and diverse work of Bob Dylan. It is their precise playing and high energy renditions of Dylan's work from the 1970s onwards which has gathered momentum and generated incredible interest. From a modest project recognising Dylan's 70th Birthday in 2011 Simply Dylan has gone from selling out the Cavern Club 6 times, to impressing Dylan fans from across the UK on their Tours with SJM Concerts to opening up the Isle of Wight Festival on the Big Top Stage. No ordinary interpretation, this is a remarkable and exceptional project which promises to delight Dylan fans young and old and to ignite a new wave of passion for one of the world's most prodigious songwriters.

> "…the night belonged to SIMPLY DYLAN and the genius of John O'Connell. Together, they marry the extraordinary range and beauty of Dylan's lyrics with a joyous and exuberant, celebratory sound.” - Alan Bleasdale (Playwright)
