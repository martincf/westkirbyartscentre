Well known for his environmental anthems and timely protest songs, Neil Young composed some of the most poignant and heartfelt love songs of any of the 1970s singer/songwriters. A series of bittersweet, breathtakingly honest ballads helped create his lonesome, often dark persona, at odds with his superstar status.

Albums such as Harvest, After The Goldrush, and later classics such as Harvest Moon, became essential bedsit listening.

Wirral's Dean Johnson, a lifelong fan of the Canadian maverick, has become a highly regarded interpreter of Young's material.

This special performance to coincide with Valentines weekend,
examines ‘the heart of Neil Young’.

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs.
