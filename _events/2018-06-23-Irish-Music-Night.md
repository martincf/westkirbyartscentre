Another evening of Irish folk music with John Walsh and Keith Price, following on from their successful St Patrick's evening in March.

John (guitar/lead vocals) and Keith (fiddle, mandolin, melodian and harmonica) were both members of Irish band Cream of the Barley which formed in the early 80's. Over the years the group worked with the top names in Irish folk music. Their annual St. Patrick's Day concert became a special event for Irish music lovers. They have worked on TV and radio and featured in Willie Russell's film 'Dancing Through the Dark'.

This evening, they are joined by two gifted traditional musicians - uillian piper, John Turton and melodian player, Jennie Nolan.

Doors open at 7pm, performance from 7.30pm, licensed bar.
