Every so often a new voice emerges, one so stunning that it knocks you sideways. Jackson has been compared to a young Richard Thompson and for once these are not empty
words –  Acoustic Magazine

Reminds me of Jeff Buckley, which can only be a good thing – Mark Radcliffe BBC Radio 2

Two words, bloody brilliant – Maverick 5 star review

Luke has already acquired both an unmistakable voice and a strikingly individual vision – fRoots Magazine

It comes as no surprise that Luke Jackson is continually feted as one of the British folk scene’s bright young things – R2 Magazine

One of the most faultless live recordings ever in my opinion – he’s a great songwriter with a great voice and boy can he sing the blues! – Mike Harding

Jackson is one of the most dynamic and exciting live performers of his generation – Folk Radio UK

He has a stage presence that many artists would kill for and a voice and guitar style that make you think that he’s a sixty year veteran who happens to have discovered the fountain
of eternal youth – Fatea Magazine

If you think previous comparisons to Richard Thompson jump the gun, think again; because there’s something that sets this performance a discreet cut above the rest –
Edinburgh Fringe Festival Review

Very powerful-impressive songs, individual playing and the singing-oh man the singing! – Folkcast

A sumptuous voice loaded with maturity and a melodically blessed guitar style – Spiral Earth

Luke Jackson sings with an extraordinarily rich voice and possesses a guitar technique astonishing for one so young. I first heard him sing four years ago and even then his
songwriting suggested a performer of rare promise” – Steve Knightley, Show of Hands

Luke Jackson has an incredibly mature and expressive voice that can holler the blues or give sensitive treatment to his own more personal tales – R2 magazine
