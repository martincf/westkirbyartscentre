Barn Dance (Or Cider Ceildh) for Wirral Pomona

A convivial celebration of words, music, food, drink & dance inspired by Robbie Burns.

With live music & a few songs from Jo, Anita, John, Melrose Melody Makers & guests.

Rosie will lead you on a merry dance, guiding you through the steps & calling the dances.

There's a Burns Supper menu (vegan/veggie & meaty varieties of Haggis!) and a taste of our
own Wirral-made apple Delights

Wirral Pomona helps local communities press surplus apples into juice and cider.
