The Celebrated and Friends at Christmas

The concert will be performed by the WKACâ€™s house band, The Celebrated, in aid of West Kirby Arts Centre. We are inviting all our Members to join us, for free, in appreciation of their support for the Centre.

The Celebrated have been performing concerts in aid of charities for the last 5 years, along with invited guests they will treat you to some of their own original songs and the work of artists that have inspired them over the years (and they have each had plenty of years over which to be inspired!) including songs by Bob Dylan (of course) Leonard Cohen (my favourite) Donovan (my second favourite) Bruce Springsteen and many others.

Come and join us for what will be a great night to Celebrate the work of the Centre and to start getting you in the mood for Christmas.
