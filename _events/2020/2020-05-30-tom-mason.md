We welcome back the on and only Tom Mason touring the UK in May with Sage Snider, the violinist in his band Tom Mason and the Blue Buccaneers.

“Tom Mason isn't just a songwriter, singer and guitar virtuoso, he's a terrific entertainer.” “his pirate songs have choruses that the audience can bellow along with, the best way to enjoy pirate music” John Baur, co-creator of “Talk Like a Pirate Day”

“Tom succeeds in setting a buccaneer mood for a party, voyage or road trip by evoking the romanticized life of the Golden Age of Pirates. Refill your tankard and enjoy the passage, me hearties.” Linda Collison, fyddeye.com”

"Somewhere in the twilight zone between Tom Waits and Kid Creole & his Coconuts there's lots of room for rocky, bluesy Vaudevillians like Nashville's Tom Mason. Mason is a raconteur in the '30s cabaret tradition, where Brecht & Weill met the Ringling Bros & Barnum and Bailey. Absolutely not your average Nashville singer/songwriter, but rather one who could have penned "Sympathy for the Devil," that's close to his style of epic storytelling........Tom's show was brilliant, and so is his album. Check it out. This guy is different, entertaining AND brilliant!” - Evert Wilbrink — FolkWax Magazine

““Red-hot resonator and slide guitar expert and Americana songwriter” “Mason is noted not only for his impressive and versatile guitar playing but for his gritty songwriting and amiable stage presence”.”
— The Nashville Rage
