Following last years sucxess Izzy returns with her piano pupils to form a band for the day.

Of course we will hear some pieces from Izzy herself in support of her pupils who will be playing their favourite pieces in a band made up of LIPA students: Macca Taylor, Ellie Keegan and Andy Gill

Expect to hear some great classical pieces along with music from Earth Wind and Fire, U2, Shakiri, Europe, Capaldi, Lennon and McCartney, Keane, Pharrel, Adele and Mayday Parade.

Come and enjoy an early evening with great music from up and coming young musicians.
