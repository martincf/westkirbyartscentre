Oisín is a Singer/Songwriter from Liverpool, with such a distinctive powerful voice. He has such a great ability at performing a whole range of styles of music with such a soulful twist. Oisín is greatly influenced by old music and grew up listening to Soul, Folk and Blues Music.

Oisín has continued to grow by creating his own nights of Live Music... which consists of hours of music with other local, talented musicians...offering them a well earned platform to showcase their music...at his own events being half of the events team which is Osh & Little Wolf.
Osh & Little Wolf events have taken place at many well established venue’s across Liverpool.

The future looks bright for Oisín... with the release of his own video called ‘Anyone’s Hero’ reaching well over 6,000 hits. Oisín is now creating his own ticketing event headlining at the beautiful venue The West Kirby Arts Centre.

Thom Morecroft - https://www.facebook.com/ThomMorecroftMusic/

Played on BBC 6 Music by Tom Robinson and described by ex-editor of NME, Q, Mojo and Word Paul Du Noyer as “cheering and addictive”, Thom Morecroft is a British singer-songwriter from Shropshire, living in Liverpool.

Born in Shrewsbury in the early 1990s and moving away to Liverpool where he was a student in the early 2010s, he became part of a vital, healthily populated scene of acoustic singer-songwriters in the north-west. He developed an idiosyncratic live performance and  a distinctive vocal style.

Thom has opened for the likes of Robert Vincent, Roxanne de Bastion, Beans on Toast and Will Varley and toured his EP and single releases in the UK and Germany.
He is currently finishing work on his upcoming crowdfunded 14-track album ‘The Feng Shui & The Sushi’.

Gareth Heesom - https://m.facebook.com/heesommusic/

Gareth is a singer/songwriter from Runcorn. He plays a wide range of music from Americana Folk and Country music.  Gareth has a great story telling style to his music and puts in a lot of emotion to each performance.

Gareth has a single out which is called “A Million Butterflies”.  Which is available on Amazon, iTunes and Google with all the profits from the song going to Halton Haven Hospice.
I am delighted to have Gareth joining us on the 24th and looking forward to listening to them both on the night.

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
