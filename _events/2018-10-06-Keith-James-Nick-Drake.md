Keith James

## A haunting and immaculately crafted concert.

### The Songs of Nick Drake

This concert begins with an introductory set of timeless songs by brilliant songwriters – all contemporary with Nick Drake. Richard Thompson, Roy Harper, Sandy Denny, Al Stewart, Vashti Bunyan, John Martyn and Bert Jansch.

Also featured are poems by William Blake which Keith has set to guitar arrangements based on Nick’s unique style.

Nick Drake is the most revered and loved of all this country’s singer/songwriters. He recorded three cherished Albums between 1969 and 1972 but was almost entirely unknown in his day. After his tragic death in 1974, aged only 26, his music almost disappeared into obscurity. Now, thanks to a massive resurgence of interest and a worldwide re-evaluation of his genius, Nick Drake has become a National treasure. An important book, Remembered for a while has been recently released, written by his elder Sister Gabrielle Drake. This volume throws light on almost everything attributed to Nick’s brief career as a songwriter and recording artist as well as on many corners of mystery and supposition.

A number of years have now passed since singer/guitarist Keith James paralysed the whole country with his stunningly beautiful series of concerts entitled The Songs of Nick Drake. At the beginning of the project in 2001 he was the first artist ever to bring this fragile and intriguing music to theatres across the UK in its pure live concert form. The end result was over a decade of highly acclaimed concerts amounting to over 1500 shows in venues in the UK, Ireland, Holland, France, Italy and Spain including all of Nick’s Schools and Colleges – even Glastonbury Festival.
