'Another Fine Mess' Live 'on air' from the 5th-7th April

Written and Directed by Amy Marshall and Mathew Johnston a 'Green Room production' from the Woolgatherers

‘Another Fine Mess’ is a farcical play-within-a-play, staged around the concept of ‘The Cat and the Canary’ murder mystery. Martin, an enthusiastic but struggling radio station manager, comes to the conclusion that his career is in jeopardy. Therefore, in order to redeem himself, he decides to hire a group of amateur actors who have never met before, to rehearse then perform live on his radio show the following day. Written by two fellow thespians, be sure to come and witness this tragic comedy!

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
