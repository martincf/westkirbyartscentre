Come and hear a pick of handwritten songs from Waxing Lyrical - the Wirral Singer/songwriter group based here at West Kirby Arts Centre.

You will hear piano, guitar, fiddle and mandolin players match their instrumental talents with fine lyrics and vocals.

Styles range from folk to country to contemporary to blues and back again! With both solo and group performances

The players are all local and several have already made recordings

The concert is being given in aid of Tyddn Mon - a residential centre for adults with learning difficulties supported by Mencap.
