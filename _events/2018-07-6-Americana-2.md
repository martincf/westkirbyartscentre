The Celebrated and Friends present an evening celebrating and exploring great American songs and artists.

The Celebrated are the West Kirby Arts Centre house band with a core group of five musicians (Bob Glass, Glyn Jones, Craig Mackintosh, Gareth Padfield and Trevor Smith) formed in 2015 to perform concerts to raise money for charities and have been doing so ever since, with many invited guest musicians. The ‘American 2’ concert will be their 17th performed at the West Kirby Arts Centre.

Their chosen charity for this concert is [Asylum Link Merseyside](http://www.asylumlink.org.uk) - Charity number 1095180.

We hope you enjoy their music and please give generously for this incredibly worthwhile cause.
