We are very pleased to present Chris and Kellie While for what we expect to be a night to remember:

Chris who left The Albion Band in 1991 was described as "The best singer in England" by Eddi Reader.

> "She rises like an angel from the ashes with a voice to match" – The Guardian

> “She has the heart of a poet and the eyes of a painter. Her writing is literate, credible, forthright and honest. Her voice is beautiful, a term I very rarely use when describing the deliveries of most singers. It is emotion packed without ever being melodramatic, compassionate without being needlessly sentimental, damning when she fervently believes certain issues need to be confronted head on, but always making for compelling listening. A quite superb album from one of the most notable women, currently living up to the reputation she has quite painstakingly built over a number of years in the contemporary folk scene.” – Maverick Magazine (five stars)

> "People will try to compare Chris While's voice to others but as Folk Roots wrote of her, "She learns from many, takes from few and comes away her own woman, She is quite simply a skillful, powerful and beautiful singer/songwriter and superb guitarist at the top of her game."
​
One the biggest joys in Chris's life however is to sing with her Daughter .....

### Kellie While

In her mid-twenties, after years of touring with The Albion Band, e2K and as a solo performer Kellie decided to pursue a career in radio production. However, Kellie still finds some time each summer to play a handful of gigs with her Mum.

Each December she also takes to the road with The Albion Christmas Band (alongside Ashley Hutchings, Simon Nicol and Simon Care), which has been touring for 20 years and attracts sell-out audiences across the UK.

As a guest vocalist, Kellie has been a much sought-after contributor to other people's projects including albums by artists such as Martin Simpson, Black Sedan, Roy Bailey and Thea Gilmore and live collaborations with Eddi Reader, Beth Nielsen Chapman and Fairport Convention.
​
Kellie has been the producer of the BBC Folk Awards for the last half dozen years or so and Mark Radcliffe's Folk show before that. She has produced and written many acclaimed documentaries for Radio 4.
