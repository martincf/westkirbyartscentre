## Losing weight is not vanity, it's a life necessity!

Take this easy and important step towards your health and the best version of yourself. Keto Life Coach will change the way you view and experience food.

### What is keto?

Keto is a diet that works for everybody, following a very simple protocol. A ketogenic diet is not new, it is not a fad diet, and it is not expensive. It is a sustainable, and delightful way of eating that your body will love.

The diet works by forcing your body to use fat instead of ingested carbohydrates for fuel. In a nutshell, you will be losing weight rapidly, with no hunger and you will feel great long-term benefits in a sustainable way.

On top, the byproduct of burning fats are ketones, which are a great source of energy for your brain.

### About the workshop

You will learn about the most effective way to look after your body and your health. You will learn why  (and how) you can shed body weight without exercise in keto, and how to optimise your well-being.
