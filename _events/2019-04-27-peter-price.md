We welcome Peter Price, a guitarist/singer with brilliant international reputation following a musical career which has so far taken him to festivals and concert venues throughout the UK, Europe and North America.

A gifted performer, his concerts and performances take the listener on strange and exotic journeys from the country blues style of Robert Johnson, Blind Willie McTell, and Leadbelly, to Latin American dances , Celtic Pipe and Harp tunes,Hymns and Indian Ragas.

His performances  demonstrate a mind- boggling mastery of the acoustic guitar , a rich singing voice, and a relaxed yet compelling stage presence. Peter’s performances have delighted audiences worldwide and guarantee an evening not to be missed."
