A night celebrating the music of John Martyn

A vibe-alike tribute that selects from across John Martyn’s unrivalled catalogue of music; the band captures the emotion and sensitivity of John’s own live performances creating an atmospheric and spontaneous tribute to the strength and intent of a true master and ensuring that the songs continue to be heard live.

This will be a full band line up including singer songwriter and Beatnix X’s Mark Byrne on guitar & vocals, Reckless Elbow’s Phil McGinity on keys, Pete Hughes from the Oil Chickens on bass, Mark Hook on drums, the Manouchetones’ Micky

Dunn on guitar and Harambe Maoni’s Andy Myers on saxophone. From jazz to funk to mellow folk the band bring their own individual influences and sounds that together combine to create the essence of the big man John Martyn.
