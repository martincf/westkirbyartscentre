Regan Wrea and his band. Borth on guitar, Gibbo on bass, and Jack on drums.

I've been writing songs since I was a young teen, and released a handful on Spotify last year, I have recently finished my first EP (releasing in march) all produced and recorded in my bedroom. I have been trying to my peace in life with music and my mission is to keep helping people find their own peace in my music, I've been playing gigs over Liverpool last year and continue to do the same for 2020

The EP is called Tidal Reach, it took me about 7 months to complete, the name is taken from a house on Caldy Beach and it's my first REACH to my style and the  beach vibes.
