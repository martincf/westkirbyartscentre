With a fabulous night in 2017 under his belt, Henry Priestman is very much looking forward to returning the beautiful West Kirby Arts Centre on the 29th of September.

In 2009, Henry (who wrote all those hits for The Christians in the 80’s, and Yachts’ songs in the 70’s) reinvented himself as a singer-songwriter, and released his debut solo CD 'The Chronicles of Modern Life' to critical acclaim, and singles from the album (including 'Grey’s The New Blonde') made it onto the Radio 2 playlist.

Much revered man of music 'Whispering Bob Harris' said of Henry Priestman’s album:

__'It’s absolutely brilliant.....he’s found his voice!'__

Proper Records released 'The Last Mad Surge of Youth' in 2014 and it garnered Henry the best reviews he’s had in 36 years of releasing records. His latest album (a joint affair with his guitarist Les Glover) is entitled 'Six of One and Half a Dozen of the Other', and the pair of them will be featuring songs from the new album in the set, as well as songs from his solo albums, and even a couple of Henry’s old hits, from way back when. Expect some special guests to join Hen & Les on the night, including West Kirby’s own Dr Nick Silver on violin!

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
