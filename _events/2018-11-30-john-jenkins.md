John is a Liverpool born singer songwriter.

Previously with bands The Persuaders & Come in Tokio, Jenkins has supported the likes of Elvis Costello, The Beat, Echo and The Bunnymen appearing on a half dozen BBC Radio 1 Sessions back in the day including three sessions for the legendary John Peel.

For 20 years John came out of the music industry but still had the urge to play and in late 2014 returned to the front line when he won an award at the Liverpool Acoustic Songwriter's Challenge. Since then, he's not looked back.

He was selected to take part in the 2018 Americana Music Association UK Songwriting Workshop in front of prestigious Songwriting panel consisting of Chris Difford, Mary Gauthier, Beth Nielsen Chapman and Sam Baker
Feedback received was “That was Brilliant” “It’s a beautiful song”

He has released several singles and a debut solo album “Trains” to favourable reviews in late 2016. His new solo album “Window Shopping in Nashville” (a 21 track Double CD) was released in September 2017.
