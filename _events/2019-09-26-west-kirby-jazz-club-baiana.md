We are Baiana

Baiana is the band with the totally tropical twist. We play the music we love and people love the music we play. Born in Liverpool and blessed in Rio, we bring the music, glamour and charm of Brazilian jazz and pop to every show.

Our performances celebrate the music of Brazil with a treasure chest of classic Bossa Novas, seductive sambas and Latin inspired arrangements of other well-known standards.

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
