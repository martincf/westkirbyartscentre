Zervas and Pepper are singer/songwriters that have been crafting songs and capturing imaginations with their previous critically acclaimed albums 'Lifebringer' and 'Abstract Heart', and 2017 brought a fresh offering in ‘Wilderland'

Coming to West Kirby Arts Centre with a stripped back acoustic set expected to be transported with wild tales, soaring harmonies, open tunings and psychedelic leanings. Zervas & Pepper have their roots firmly planted in the rich and fertile soil of the legendary sound of Laurel Canyon.

‘Wilderland’ was written in a cabin in the Colorado rocky mountains, The duo taking refuge from a troubled world,
The songwriters underwent the process of writing an album that would be infused by the nature around them, A muse that would only be interrupted by their concerns for the outside world.

Recording started in LA with James Raymond (Crosby, Stills and Nash/CPR) with James co-producing and performing on part of the album. Recording then resumed with long time band and engineer Llion Robertson on home soil in rural Mid Wales.
