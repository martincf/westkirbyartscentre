Dana and Susan Robinson were one of our first touring artists from America, two years ago. They may not be back again for a while so catch them this time around, I promise you will not be disappointed.

Dana & Susan Robinson are two guitar-playing, banjo-frailing, fiddle-sawing, harmony-singing interpreters of the American experience. Their unique blend of song writing and traditional
Appalachian music brings to their performances a deep understanding of America’s musical heritage.

Dirty Linen magazine said, “Many songwriters such as Bruce Springsteen or John Mellencamp have been heralded as modern day Woody Guthries or keepers of the American rural spirit,
but that mantle might be better entrusted to musicians like Dana Robinson who embody both the heart and soul of folk music.”

> “…have long been one of my favourite American roots duos, their old-timey music I think, is absolutely superb… great stuff.” Mike Harding

> “…among the finest American artists currently working on the folk music scene… this is a joy to me… wonderful sound, great voices and superb musicianship, you’ll have to go a long way to beat Dana & Susan Robinson.” Frank Hennessy, Celtic Heartbeat, BBC Radio Wales

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs.
