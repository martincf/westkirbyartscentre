If you missed this one last year here is your chance to experience the wonderful combination of Tennessee Waltz with the Helsby Mountain String band. A foot stomping, banjo flailing, frantic fiddle playing mayhem of Country, Bluegrass and Americana. 

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
