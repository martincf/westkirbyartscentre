We welcome back John Walsh and Keith Price, Cream of the Barley, for their ever popular Irish Music Night.

They are joined again, by popular demand, by Hughie Jones who you will know as One of the original members of 'The Spinners'.
Hughie is still going strong and last year produced a magical night here at the Art Centre. We are all looking forward to his return.

Book early to avoid disappointment.

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
