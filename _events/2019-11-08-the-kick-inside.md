The Kick Inside, an acoustic celebration of The Songs Of Kate Bush, is the alter-ego of Raf and O who have marked out their unique and widely acclaimed song and sound world over the last decade.

With special collaborations under their belt, they've played venues such as The Queen Elizabeth Hall and The Union Chapel, composed music for theatre and were praised by Mike Garson, David Bowie’s pianist and long term collaborator for their unique interpretation of Bowie’s Lady Grinning Soul. Their 4th full length album will be released in 2019.

The Kick Inside focus on Kate's early career and core essence as a pianist singer songwriter

Raf Mantelli - Vocals, Piano

## The Kick Inside Press

"Strikingly individual. Kate's early songs performed like this make us want to be in some candlelit cabaret club in Paris or Berlin cosying up to a large glass of red in a plush velvet boot" – Kate Bush News

“Alluring, atmospheric duo Raf and O launch their THE KICK INSIDE project - a beautifully realised, heartfelt re-imagining of a Kate Bush who kept on playing live…” – Adrian Specs

"Utterly fantastic!" – Dexter Bentley, London Resonance FM

"Raf Mantelli from our favourite avant-garde duo Raf and O adds her idiosyncratic, enchanting signature to the music of Kate Bush on her latest project, The Kick Inside.” – Monolith Cocktail

“There's a very real sense that Raf made these songs her own and created a Kate Bush persona in which to perform them. It takes a very special talent to bring this off: Raf possesses it and deployed it brilliantly last night." – Jeremy Clarke Reviews
