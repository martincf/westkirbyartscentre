We are very pleased to present Chris While and Julie Matthews for what we expect to be a night to remember…

One of the finest and most loved duos on the British and World folk/roots stages.

> “They light up the room with their amazing energy” – James Taylor

> "Truly gifted human beings" – Richard Hawley

With more than 25 years of unrivalled musical partnership and gathering numerous nominations, awards  and critical acclaim along the way, much beloved British singer-songwriters Chris While and Julie Matthews celebrated a quarter of a century last year as one of the best loved and most prolific female duos to come out of this country.

Chris While (vocals, guitar, banjo, dulcimer, bodhran and percussion) & Julie Matthews (vocals, piano, guitar, mandolin and bouzouki) are stunning singers, songwriters, musicians and performers whose energy and commitment to their craft and their audience is boundless.

They are two of the best and most hard working musicians on the world folk roots scene, both are highly regarded producers and they record everything that they are involved in at their own studio in a small pennine town far from the Londoncentric music industry. They truly are inspirational women.

Chris and Julie have been nominated ten times in the BBC Radio 2 Folk music awards in the 'Best Song, Best Duo, Best Live Act' categories and winning Best Duo in 2009 but it is their longstanding and devoted growing fans that they care about most.

2017 saw them perform at the Royal Albert Hall as part of the Folk Awards alongside Boo Hewerdine, John McCusker and Kris Drever. They were performing songs from the Ballads Of Child Migration, a project that covers the sad history of forced child migration and became a major tour in November 2018.

Chris and Julie are on top form and can't put a foot wrong fRoots.
