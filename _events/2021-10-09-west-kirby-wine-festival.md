Following the success of their Wine Festivals at The Unitarian on Ullet Road in Liverpool, we are delighted to be hosting Dove and Olive's first event on The Wirral. Join us to raise a glass as the nights draw in at our Autumn Wine Festival.

Dove and Olive will be bringing you a selection of 30- 40 of their favourite wines from across the new and old worlds, some organic, some biodynamic, some vegan wines and some that aren't but they love them anyway. All of the wines they will be showcasing will be great examples of their place and style, handcrafted by passionate producers.

This relaxed event isn't a formal wine tasting its designed for you to enjoy a range of wines that you might not usually try, with friends in a beautiful building and if you fancy having a chat about the wines or want some tips about how to taste in a more structured way we can do that too.

Dove and Olive's focus at this Autumn event will be on seasonal fuller bodied reds, whites, orange wines and sparkling varieties.

There will be live acoustic music, a wine quiz and turntable spinning some favourite vinyl to keep you entertained and will also offer a selection of beers, spirits and soft drinks to keep the less enthusiastic wine drinkers happy. As you would expect there will also be some cheese and nibbles to compliment the wine.

Tickets are £10pp and include entry, your first glass of wine and then you can choose to buy as many wine tokens as you would like for tasters of the wines on offer. We serve all the wines in tasting sizes priced between £2-4 depending on the variety which makes this a great value way to try lots of wines at the same time which will challenge your palate and highlight all the different styles and flavours of the wines.

All of the wines will also be available to take home at discounted prices from Dove and Olive's bottle shop.

Licensed bar available.
