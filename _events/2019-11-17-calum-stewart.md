## MG ALBA Scottish Traditional Instrumentalist of the Year 2018.

Award winning, virtuoso Uilleann Piper Calum Stewart’s powerful and lyrical playing style, is rooted in the traditional music of his native Northern Scotland. His distinct musical voice has been developed through collaborations within the Scottish and Irish traditions.

In addition to his concert schedule, Calum is in demand as a recording artist, with recent work including recordings and performances with The London Philharmonic Orchestra, The London Symphony Orchestra and BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.

_“Seriously class playing.”_ – BBC Radio Scotland.

_“A musician of outstanding virtuosity… Mountain-air piping clarity.”_ – Irish Music Magazine.

_“Hits you right between the eyes.  Outstanding”_ – The Living Tradition.

_“Calum Stewart joins the ranks of thoroughly modern Uilleann Pipers, who are steeped in their own tradition but cross borders to bring in other influences, and can write a damned fine tune”_ – Folk Radio

_“A beautifully crafted piece of music in every sense”_ – BBC Pipeline
