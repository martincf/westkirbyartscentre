## About Matt

Matt McGuinness, writer, musician and performer, takes his solo show “We are what we overcome” around the country.

This inspiring one-man performance combines heartfelt conversation, punctuated with uplifting, anthemic original rock and roll tunes.

Shedding light on mental health, with self-deprecating honesty and dark humour, this is especially for  anyone who has ever overcome one of life’s many challenges or is battling to do so.

“Sometimes you’ve got to find your own way of dealing with Mental Health problems and if the Arts and conversation is one way why not on a stage in front of a room full of strangers.”

## Reaching Out and Raising Awareness
As the show tackles the subject of mental health, there will be space afterwards for discussion and questions from the audience, in the form of a Q&A and/or an informal meet and greet, as well as raising money for all three charities through donations.

## Stats and Support Links
In 2018, the Samaritans reported that male suicide rates were at their lowest for more than thirty years. Samaritan’s CEO Ruth Sutherland believes that “the focus of suicide prevention in recent years to tackle the higher rates in men has contributed to this. Added to this, reducing stigma around men’s mental health and encouraging men to open up and ask for help when they are struggling has been beneficial. But one death by suicide is still one too many”.

It's not just men who are a concern, our young and elderly people are struggling with a loneliness epidemic, with more people living alone than ever before. David Halpern, British Psychologist and Civil Servant is quoted as saying "If you have got someone who loves you, someone you can talk to if you have got a problem, that is a more powerful predictor of whether you will be alive in 10 years' time, more than almost any other factor, certainly more than smoking."

This tour aims not just to portray Matt’s story, but to encourage others to tell theirs by bring local communities together to make connections and new friends.

Safety Message for listeners/readers: If you are concerned that you are developing a mental health problem you should seek the advice and support of your GP as a matter of priority.
