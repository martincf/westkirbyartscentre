Written and Performed by Matt McGuinness

Fresh from a successful run at the Edinburgh Fringe, musician, performer and writer Matt McGuinness presents his debut show as part of a UK tour. Uplifting, anthemic tunes punctuate stories and conversation, shedding light on mental health with self-deprecating honesty and dark humour. This show is for anyone who has ever overcome one of life’s many challenges or is battling to do so.

A 55-minute show with time to continue the chat afterwards.

‘Moments of bright energy shine through’ Storge

‘Songs with substance, somewhere between Folk, Gospel & pure Rock n Roll’ Liveamp.com

We Are What We Overcome is supported by Mind, The Samaritans and the Mental Health Foundation.

Mental Health Awareness Week 13th - 19th May 2019

Followed by a Q&A with writer and performer Matt McGuinness.
