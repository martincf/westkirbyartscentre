‘All Together Now’ Concert by The Celebrated West Kirby Arts Club Band to be held at:

**The Unitarian Church Hall, 57 Ullet Road, Sefton Park, Liverpool.** [See on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/5PFkh4pH7qj).

Raising Funds for Liverpool’s Whitechapel Centre.

The Celebrated are a group of Wirral musicians who perform concerts for charities; ‘All Together Now’ is our 18th. Come along and listen to what we sing; relax and "let us take you down cos’ we’re going to" explore the music of the Beatles during that amazing, creative period in the late 1960s when their candle burned bright.
