**Legendary mountaineer Doug Scott gives a fascinating insight into how a lad born in
Nottingham during the darkest days of WWII got into climbing on the Black Rocks in
Derbyshire - aided with nothing but his mother’s clothes line, and how this led him to
Everest in 1975.**

At dusk on 24 September, Doug and Dougal Haston became the first Britons to reach the
summit of Everest as lead climbers on Chris Bonington’s epic expedition to the mountain’s
south-west face. As darkness fell they scraped a small cave in the snow 100 metres below
the summit and survived the highest bivouac ever - without bottled oxygen, sleeping bags
and, as it turned out, frostbite.

For Doug Scott, it was the fulfilment of a fortune-teller’s prophesy given to his mother:
that her eldest son would be in danger in a high place with the whole world watching.

Scott and Haston returned home national heroes with their image splashed across the front
pages. Scott went on to become one of Britain’s greatest ever mountaineers, pioneering new
climbs in the remotest corners of the globe. His career spans the golden age of British
climbing from the 1960’s boom in outdoor adventure, to the new wave of lightweight alpinism
throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

Proceeds from the evening will support the work of Community Action Nepal
www.canepal.org.uk and include a sale of Nepalese goods and an auction of signed framed
mountaineering prints. Doug will show a short video about CAN and update the audience of
current projects in the remote region of North Gorkha. He will also be signing copies of
his posters and books.
