"Finding treasure feels great, and such is the case with musician Sarah McQuaid. The soulful singer, smart and sensuous songwriter, and scintillating guitarist has been hidden in plain sight with three gorgeous solo albums, and her fourth -- the recently-released, critically-acclaimed Walking Into White -- reveals a truly magnificent artist primed to enchant the masses.

...I've attended hundreds of concerts of all kinds, and her subtle mastery onstage launches her straight into my fave shows ever. One voice, one guitar, and the wondrous reminder of the magic of music. Sarah has the gift." -- Gregory Weinkauf, The Huffington Post

"The echoing magic of ‘Walking into White’, the latest album from Sarah McQuaid, seizes you from the first and holds you captured long after the last notes fade.... Sending out a trembling resonance, this is a collection of songs that feel their way into your being." -- Tim Carroll, FolkWords

   "The songs are acutely observed and literate, almost like journal notes set to music. They're measured and tranquil but they're never dull because there is always a sense of restlessness and unease behind the poetry.... And it's all lovely." -- Ian Pickles, R2/Rock 'n' Reel.
