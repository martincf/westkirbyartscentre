Bullets and Daffodils is the worldâ€™s first musical production to be based on war poetry of Wilfred Owen.

Written by Wirral singer/songwriter Dean Johnson, the original associate director was the much loved actor Christopher Timothy (James Herriott, All Creatures Great and Small).

Past cast members include Christopher Timothy, Nicholas Ball, well known for his portrayal of James Hazell in the iconic 70's detective series Hazell; Dean Sullivan, known for his
role as Jimmy Corkhill in Brookside.

The show recasts Wilfred Owen's poems as contemporary songs, the script contains contributions from Dr Who writer David Quantick and music from Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.

The first performance took place in 2011. The show was the subject of a BBC documentary, following its development from Birkenhead to London's West End.

All 3 singles released from the show have received airplay on BBC Radio 2.

The poetry of Wilfred Owen, for so long the reserve of school classrooms, is reborn in this unique production. As the centenary of World War One reaches its climax, Owen has become the poster boy of war poetry.

Owen remains a controversial figure. He comes second only to Shakespeare as our most famous national poet. His story remains largely untold and is one of the most captivating
in recent history.

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs.
Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
