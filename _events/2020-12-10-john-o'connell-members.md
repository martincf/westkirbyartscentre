John O’Connell is one of Liverpool’s firm favourites. The remarkable partnership and infectious stage presence he had with the late Graham Evans in Groundpig saw hundreds of people attend their gigs every week. Their musicianship and seemingly endless repertoire from a range of genres had their young fans mesmerised. Since the passing of Graham, John has reinvented himself concentrating his time on his song writing, refining his classical guitar technique and putting on his own concerts. He has supported Martin Carthy, Gordon Haskell,  Sean Lakeman & Kathryn Roberts and has toured the UK with the American songwriter Stephen Bishop.

Much of John’s time these days is spent touring the UK with his Simply Dylan band but much to the delight of his Liverpool fans John is dedicating more time to all of his disciplines and going back to his roots. John will be performing a Christmas gig at the West Kirby Arts Centre, in April, where he will be playing an eclectic set including some brand new original songs along with some classic guitars tunes. Joined by his band the night promises a diverse and engaging set delivered by musicians at the top of their game.

"...everytime I see him, he never ceases to amaze me with his guitar dexterity, (both acoustic and classical), his singing, his song writing and his ability to cover well-known songs to perfection. I mean the 'Urban Troubadour', otherwise known as John O'Connell."
