The Roving Crows have been carving out their niche in the UK folk music scene since early 2009.

Over ten years and evolving incarnations Roving Crows have cultivated an arresting, singular sound that pushes the boundaries of the Celtic Folk genre. The band play with
genuine passion, energy and soul. Vital and vibrant, a must see live act who showcase a mix of fiery, Celtic-inspired fiddle, conscious, intelligent lyrics, backed by solid, thumping rhythms and driving, innovative bass. Roving Crows comprises; strong lead vocals and 4 part harmonies, guitar, fiddle, percussion and bass.

Formed in 2009 by Barrett and O’Neill, the band have created 3 albums; ‘Bacchanalia’ 2012, ‘Deliberate Distractions’ 2013 and the latest, ‘Bury Me Naked’ which was released in Spring
2017 to critical acclaim from across the world. The former two releases were produced by Nick Brine (Ash, Oasis, Bruce Springsteen, Seasick Steve) at Rockfield Studios and ‘Bury Me Naked’ was self-produced with former bass player with the band, Loz Shaw.

They have wowed festival audiences from Cambridge and Trowbridge to Cheltenham Jazz Festival as well as numerous headline appearances in France & Ireland alongside an
international tour in 2018 to Australia.  Band of the Year in the 2014 FATEA Music Awards and Best Live Act in the Spiral Awards in the same year, they were also winners of the 2017
