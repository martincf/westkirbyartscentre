My name is Billy Kemp, and I’m a musician. I’ve been playing guitar for forty-five years and also play the banjo, bass, harmonica, piano and anything you can get a sound out of.

I live in Nashville, Tennessee where I have hung my hat infrequently, since I spend so much of my time on the road. I average five or six tours annually, which take me all over the United States, Canada and the British Isles. I like hearing the ways people talk, especially their different accents. And then there are all of the stories.
