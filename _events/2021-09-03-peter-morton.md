Pete Morton is a folk singer-songwriter with a wealth of great songs and a remarkable singing voice.

A compelling and energetic performer whose songs have been described as an unruly mix of humour, politics, love and social comment wrapping their way around the folk tradition. Songs like ‘Another Train’ and ‘When we sing together’ have become folk club standards and his performances are a joy.
