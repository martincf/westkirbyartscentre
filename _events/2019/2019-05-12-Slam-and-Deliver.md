Get ready to ride the highway for the First Poetry Slam of the first ever Wirral Poetry Festival!  

In a fast and furious spoken-word-stand-off, 12 of the UK's hottest slammers will compete in the ultimate bardic battle.

Expect adrenaline fuelled performances and an electrifying and inspiring, live literature event as our poets compete for the Wirral Poetry Festival Slam Prize 2019. Come along and cheer your favourites.

Winners prize Â£50.

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church.
Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs.
Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
