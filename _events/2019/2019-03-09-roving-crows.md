Award Winning Celtic Fusion.

Roving Crows have been carving out their niche in the UK folk music scene since early 2009.  

Over eight years and evolving incarnations Roving Crows have cultivated an arresting, singular sound that pushes the boundaries of the Celtic Folk genre. The band play with genuine passion, energy and soul. Vital and vibrant, a must see live act who showcase a mix of fiery, Celtic-inspired fiddle, conscious, intelligent lyrics, backed by pounding tribal rhythms and electronica infused dance grooves. Roving Crows comprises; Lead vocals from Paul O’Neill and Caitlin Barrett, Paul’s electric and acoustic guitars, Caitlin’s fiddle, Loz Shaw on electric 5 and 6 string bass, keyboards, guitars and clarinet, and pumping percussion from Tim Downes-Hall.

Formed in 2009 by Barrett and O'Neill, the band have created 3 albums; ‘Bacchanalia’ 2012, ‘Deliberate Distractions’ 2013 and the latest, ‘Bury Me Naked’ which was released in Spring 2017 and to critiacle acclaim from across the world. The former two releases were produced by Nick Brine (Ash, Oasis, Bruce Springsteen, Seasick Steve) at Rockfield Studios and ‘Bury Me Naked’ was self-produced with Loz Shaw handling the engineering. They have wowed festival audiences from Cambridge and Trowbridge to Cheltenham Jazz Festival as well as numerous headline appearances in France & Ireland. Band of the Year in the 2014 FATEA Music Awards and Best Live Act in the Spiral Awards in the same year, they were also winners of the 2017 Australian Celtic Music Awards (International Artist of the Year category), adding to their previous accolades in the Irish Music Association Awards for Top Celtic Rock Band and Top Fiddle Player.
