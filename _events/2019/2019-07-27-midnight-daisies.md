Midnight Daisies have been together for over 10 years. They have been playing venues around the North West since then, most recently The Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, The Cavern and The Big Room Live.  

Their original songs are composed by lead singer/guitarist Freya Halvorsen and are influenced by her love of jazz/blues/gypsy jazz and pop. The songs range from memorable and catchy tunes to slow jazz blues numbers. Midnight Daisies will appeal to all tastes.

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs.
Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
