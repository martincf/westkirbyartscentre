Join us for a creative pilgrimage to the island of Hilbre, local poets will follow in the footsteps of the dark giant of verse Ted Hughes to discover inspiration in his recurring themes of ‘Beauty’ and ‘Isolation’.

The participants will tap into the muse of the unspoilt solitude of the lonely island situated a stone’s throw from the hustle and bustle of Wirral life.

Once we get to Hilbre acclaimed Wirral singer/songwriter Dean Johnson  will cast new perspectives on Ted's work, as he sets extracts of Hughes’ masterpiece ‘Crow’ to music, and illuminates those dark violent lines as contemporary folk/rock songs.

The fruits of this sojourn will be shared on the 14th July, at West Kirby Arts Centre. See the seperate listing for details.

The picnic will commence at 8.00am and we will return for 4.00pm and it is being organised in conjunction with The Festival of Firsts as part of their 2019 Poetry Festival and tickets are available from them at TicketSource. If needed you can call 0333 666 3366 for ticket information or call Tony on 07484 537 502 for more information on the Art Centre's Ted Hughes Project.
