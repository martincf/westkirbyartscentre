Charlie Dore with Julian Littman - the Dark Matter Tour 2019

A night of eclectic, contemporary folk as multi-award winner Charlie Dore, one of the UK’s most respected songwriters teams up with long-time co-pilot Julian Littman of Steeleye Span to share her latest album, Dark Matter.  

Charlie promises another fast moving show as the pair swap guitars, mandolin, harmonium, ukulele, piano and autoharp.

Dark Matter has won two awards to date, both Album of the Year and Best Lyrics from the USA Indie Acoustic Project 2018 (the only UK album to be recognised that year) although previous UK winners have included Cara Dillon, Kate Rusby and Albert Lee.

As well as introducing some new and different flavours to shine a very personal light on her mysterious subject matter, Charlie and Julian will dip into favourites from the past 6 albums and share original acoustic versions of hits Charlie has written for others, including George Harrison and Jimmy Nail. And there’s always a possibility of a new angle on her own song, Pilot of the Airwaves - still a national radio favourite.

“Dark Matter…an amazingly astute, moving, intelligent and connected songwriter…a voice

like Kate McGarrigle meets Dory Previn. Wonderful” Mike Harding

“Beautiful, existential, metaphysical and intruigingly other. Zen folk I want to call it. Charlie Dore’s ‘Time Out of Mind’“ Ricky Ross, BBC Scotland
