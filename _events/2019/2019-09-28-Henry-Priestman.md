We welcome back Henry Priestman and Friends      

“a great favourite at festivals…quirky, witty, & definitely idiosyncratic.”  Mike Harding

After over 40 years in the music business and with a credit list longer than both your arms – in 2009 Henry Priestman (having not sung since 1981!!) reinvented himself as a singer-songwriter and released his debut solo CD “The Chronicles of  Modern Life” on the famous Island Records label. He followed that up in 2014 with “The Last Mad Surge of Youth”(released on Proper Records), in 2015 a live DVD “Settle Down”, and in 2017 comes a duo album with his friend and live sidekick Les Glover entitled “Six of One & Half a Dozen of the Other”.

Both solo albums are the sound of a man who’s seen the music world explode from punk (his band Yachts supported the Sex Pistols in ’77, and The Who on European Tour in ‘79) via pop (three million albums with The Christians; a top five single for Mark Owen) through to the digital age (soundtracks for James Bond/Xbox, BBC’s Wildlife on One, Natural World), writing/production duties with the likes of singer/songwriters Lowri Evans, Amy Wadge, Lotte Mullan, 10cc’s Graham Gouldman, even Aled Jones (who covered “At The End of the Day” the opening song from “Surge..” on his last album), and still has something worth singing about.

So in this age of genre’s, niches and “tribes”, where does Henry fit in? Amazon.com seem to think he’s folk (“Chronicles...” topped the Amazon “Folk and World” charts on it’s release), Radio 2’s Johnnie Walker described Henry’s new direction as “music for grumpy old men”, The Daily Mail said he is “a master of the rueful observation”, and elsewhere the phrase “post-punk-folk-protest” has been bandied about.

Henry Priestman’s “got form,” his “previous” including Yachts (described in Gene Sculatti’s U.S. book The Catalog of Cool as“Cole Porter Punk”!), It’s Immaterial, The Christians (writing all songs on their 1987 triple-platinum debut), sharing a mic and a number one single with Paul McCartney, and composing the title song for London West End musical “Dreamboats and Petticoats”. To say nothing of a roll-call of sessions for fellow North West luminaries including Lightning Seeds, Johnny Marr, Ian McCulloch, Pete Wylie, Ian McNabb and Echo & The Bunnymen, plus vocals on Jools Holland/Tom Jones’ 2004 CD.
Tracks from his debut album (including “Grey’s The New Blond”) were playlisted at Radio 2 & featured on BBC Breakfast TV [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOiTSqpjhR0]  and his latest “Surge…” album garnered Henry the best reviews he’s had in 37 years of releasing records.
Having discovered a new found love of live work (usually with his partner-in-crime “Loved- Up Les” Glover, mixing ramshackle chaos & tear-jerking poignancy in equal measures!) he will be touring all over the UK this year (check website: www.henrypriestman.com), and is available for housegigs too (33 housegigs played in 2016!). You could say he likes to keep busy… his last mad surge of youth perhaps?
