Devon based duo Harbottle & Jonas met at Liverpool Uni where they studied music. Partners in life as well as music, combining their love of the rich stories and music of traditional folk with their own original songwriting and contemporary interpretations, they have developed a signature sound, blending concertina, harmonium, banjo, stomp box, acoustic guitar and cittern with their beautiful and closely intertwined vocal harmonies.  

Currently touring with latest album The Sea Is My Brother, Dave and Freya are currently writing for their next release and you could be the first to hear these new songs.

> “Awash with strong songs and excellent musicianship.” – Folk Radio UK

> “One of the finest folk duos in the country.” – Mike Davies, Alternative Roots.
