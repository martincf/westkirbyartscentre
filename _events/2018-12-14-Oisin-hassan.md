## Ahmed Khwaja

Ahmed has gone from strength to strength with his music. Creating a signature sound with his powerful voice.  He is able to use raw emotion
in his music. It is very honest and heartfelt.  

Ahmed is releasing a new single called “Miles From Home” on the 20th of December and is making a name for himself across Liverpool’s music scene. I am delighted to have him as a close friend and to have him join me on the 14th.
