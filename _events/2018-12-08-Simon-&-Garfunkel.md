Following on from last years successful show, We are delighted to welcome back Tim Chu & Ian Bailey to West Kirby Arts Centre on Saturday December 8th performing their acclaimed non tribute show ‘A Celebration of Simon & Garfunkel’

Tim Chu and Ian Bailey are two talented professional singer-songwriters from the North West of England.
They have grown up listening to Simon & Garfunkel’s music with both the composition and vocal blend having a strong influence on their respective professional careers.

After years of busy individual touring schedules both Tim and Ian have now found the time to concentrate on this venture delivering the music of Simon and Garfunkel in their own unique way that also honours the original recordings, without falling into the regular tribute act category.

There are no costumes, wigs or make up!  Just two great musicians producing an ambient collection of some of Simon & Garfunkel’s much loved hits”
