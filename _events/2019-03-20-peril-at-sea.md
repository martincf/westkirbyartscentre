The greatest storm in living memory blasts the English coast. Striving against the howling winds and pounding waves, a lonely boat struggles on. Those left behind wait impatiently, huddled together, isolated and unfamiliar.

As the storm rages, stories, memories, songs and myths tumble out of the night, capturing a life lived on and around the sea.

Peril at Sea is produced by Up The Road Theatre in association with New Theatre Royal Portsmouth, supported by Wells Maltings, The Seagull and LV21.

Supported by Arts Council England and The Leche Trust.
