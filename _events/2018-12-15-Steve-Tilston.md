The West Kirby Arts Centre are delighted to host the return of Steve Tilston, one of the UK’s most celebrated songsmiths with Hugh Bradley and Iain Patterson.

Widely recognised as one of the UK’s true singer songwriters, Steve was born in Liverpool and raised in the Midlands. He made his recording debut in 1971 and has been turning out quality albums ever since, all featuring first-class song-writing, quintessentially English in style and typically Tilston. Though known as a songwriter, Steve has always had an ear for tradition and includes new interpretations of old favourites on his original recordings. He is also a published author.


Well known afficionado of original music, presenter “Whispering” Bob Harris said of Steve Tilston’s music:

**_“The more you listen, the more there is to discover.”_**


Steve was awarded Male Vocalist of the Year 2015 in the Fatea Awards. Testament if needed, that after 45 years in the business Steve can still deliver the goods. His most recent solo CD Truth to Tell was chosen as one of The Telegraph’s best folk albums of 2015. In 2017, he visited West Kirby Arts Centre with fellow songwriter Jez Lowe, and delivered a great set to a packed audience. This year, he will be accompanied by the multi-talented musician Hugh Bradley and the support act will be local musician, Iain Patterson


Steve will be releasing a new album in the summer. Distant Days is a pared back voice and guitar recording, something Steve has been wanting to do for some time. Around 19 tracks – solo acoustic recollections - chosen largely by public selection via social media etc. including a previously unreleased instrumental Shinjuku inspired by Bert Jansch. Many of these songs will be included in in his concert set at West Kirby.

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
