St George's Ceili at the West Kirby Arts Centre promises to be an exiting lively evening in the company of local musicians and all to raise money for the Wirral Pomona who make cider from the apple trees of the area.

Doors will open from 6.30pm with food and the fully stocked licensed bar. Music & dancing will get ramped up after 7pm and goes on until 10pm.

## Meal/non-meal & child tickets
Our online bookable tickets are £10 (for entry and a meal).

**For advanced tickets for 6-16 years olds at £6 (including a meal) or adult tickets without a meal at the same price**, please contact the event organiser, [Dave Ellwand](mailto:pd@daveellwand.co.uk) directly . You can risk getting non-meal tickets on the door but be prepared for disappointment as last time we had a ceili, people were turned away.

### Meal preferences
Please also [contact Dave](mailto:pd@daveellwand.co.uk) to give your meat/veggie options to assist with catering.


## About Wirral Pomona
Wirral Pomona are a group of Wirral residents who want to make the most of the abundance of fruit which grows in gardens, orchards and parks in Wirral.

One way of using the thousands of apples and pears that drop each autumn is to make juice and cider. Not starting as experts themselves, they enlisted the help of WEN (Wirral Environmental Network) to buy fruit presses and scratters and now have made more themselves out of recycled materials.

They support community orchards and events with juicing and cider making, but it takes lots of work in repairing and upgrading the tools they need. Hence this fundraiser to tie in with St George's day celebrations, as well as adding to the conviviality and community spirit they share.
