Lizzy is a captivating and energetic folk singer-songwriter, playing a vibrant mix of traditional, original and contemporary music. Her delicate and interesting guitar parts mingle with her immensely powerful yet pure voice to tell a story. She writes song from the heart, mulling over the subtleties of everyday life as well as re-arranging and re-invigorating traditional tunes. After appearing as a finalist in 2018’s New Roots competition she has gone from strength to strength.

Lizzy is proving herself to be a talented songwriter, giving significance to stories old and new. Having supported acts such as Lady Maisery, Nancy Kerr, and Bob Fox is "a rising star on the folk scene not to be missed" (Kimpton Folk Events).

She has had successful radio play nationally and across the pond as well as support and headline gigs at reputable folk clubs and festivals across the country. Her new debut album
Dusk is available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2cLjG0GeFkbJ2kc3CEszrL?si=gHizolJuQvGh9rBpjNjeoQ) and all other good interweb streaming platforms, as well as the EP, Long Story Short.
