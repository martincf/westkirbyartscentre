Join with A Fistful of Spookies (UK) for an evening of comedy and song with sensational stylings of Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, The Beach Boys, a stirring of brand newies and thousand year old Georgian songs, guaranteed to woo, charm, cheer & delight. 

A Fistful of Spookies (UK) were abandoned to their own appliances when festival hits The Spooky Men’s Chorale retreated to Australia after sold-out 2015 & 2017 tours. This rambunctious collection of UK Spooks keep alive the flame of Spookiness in Britain. Magnificent fun!

With Michael Carlyon, Adrian Mealing, Philip Read, Chris Samuel, James Sills & Dom Stichbury
