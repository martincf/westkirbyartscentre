Phillip Henry Guitar Workshop

Phillip has long been established as an expert in his field, and as part of this tour package is offering a masterclass to compliment his concert.

The workshop will be a slide guitar masterclass, with room for people to ask their own questions and shape it to suit them. Phil will give background and context of his different slide guitars, explaining where they are all from and the stories attached to them. He will talk a bit about the history of slide guitar, and the different global styles. He will then go into techniques, and the attendees will have a chance to lead the workshop in the directions most useful to them.

He can give advice on gear to use, how to convert a normal guitar for lap slide, and of course all the different facets of technique. He can also point people in the direction of where to go for more info.

People are welcome to say what they’d like to learn about in advance, but the nature of how Phil runs the workshop means he will cater it to them as he goes.

The format is flexible, please discuss further by [emailing Tony Woof](Tonywoof@yahoo.co.uk) or call 07484 537 502.
