Contemporary folk/acoustic duo Gilmore & Roberts combine award-winning songwriting with astounding musicianship and their trademark harmonies to create a powerful wall of
sound.

Nominated three times at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, Katriona Gilmore (fiddle, mandolin)
and Jamie Roberts (guitar) met while studying at Leeds College of Music and released their
debut album in 2008.

Since then, the duo have toured Canada and mainland Europe, played some of the UK’s biggest
acoustic festivals, toured with folk rock legends Fairport Convention and won countless
accolades for their genre-spanning work.

Gilmore & Roberts released their fifth studio album, _A Problem Of Our Kind_, in October 2018.
