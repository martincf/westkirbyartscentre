Featuring the music of James Taylor, Carole King, Joni Mitchell plus many more, ‘Troubadors’ is a celebration of a golden age of songwriting. The decade from 1965 to 1975 saw the flourishing of a new generation of troubadour singer-songwriters on both sides of the Atlantic, whose music was both poetic and deeply personal.

Recreating the intimate atmosphere of LA’s Troubadour Club & London’s Les Cousins, the show features songs from iconic albums ‘Sweet Baby James’, ‘Blue’ and ‘Tapestry’ alongside the music of John Martyn, Nick Drake, Paul Simon and Tom Waits.

With songs handpicked from his own record collection, singer/guitarist James Sills launches ‘Troubadors’ in summer 2018 is looking forward to bringing his one-man show to festivals, venues and house concerts across the UK. James performs internationally with vocal troupe Spooky Men’s Chorale, including regular appearances at major UK folk festivals, WOMAD & live sessions for BBC Radio 2 & 3.

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
