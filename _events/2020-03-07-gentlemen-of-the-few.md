The Gents have performed all over the country for the last 9 years, regularly returning to Scotland and Europe and even organising two very successful tours of Northern Spain and
Catalonia.

Having been finalists of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and appearing on Chris Evans' "TFI Friday", and performing at hundreds of festivals and venues over the years, theyâ€™ve become a truly experienced and entertaining band to watch.

The sound is a blend of harmony-oriented vocals, explosive psychedelic and classic rock mixed with acoustic and electric country accompaniment among highly developed songwriting skills.

The set is filled with catchy originals with some nostalgic cover material."

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs.
Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
