Wet The Tea

We are pleased to have Wet the Tea back for another great night of live music, for those who have not experienced them yet they are a multi instrument act with Traditional Irish Music roots, with many other influences that creates something different from the norm. 

Their special guest for this gig will be announced shortly.
 
The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
