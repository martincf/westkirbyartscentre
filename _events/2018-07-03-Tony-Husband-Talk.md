Tony Husband astonished and delighted Festival goers in 2017 with his quick fire cartoons. Tony returns to give a talk based on the story of his father and how dementia slowly took him away from his family. This is documented in his book Take Care, Son: The Story of My Dad and his Dementia (2014).

When Ron Husband started to forget things - dates, names, appointments . . . daft things, important things - it took a while to realise that this was 'a different form of forgetting'. But it was just the first sign of the illness that gradually took him away from the family he loved. Illustrated with cartoons, Tonyâ€™s talk will tell the touching story of his father and how dementia slowly took him away from his family.
