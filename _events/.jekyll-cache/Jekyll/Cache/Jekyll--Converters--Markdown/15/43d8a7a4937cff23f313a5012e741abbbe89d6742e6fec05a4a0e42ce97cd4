I"f<p>The Wilfred Owen Story (housed within the West Kirby Arts Centre) is celebrating this year’s National Poetry day (Oct 3rd) with a creative writing event.</p>

<p>Come and join our resident poets J.E.Wilder and Christine Purcell, as they examine some of Owen’s poetry.</p>

<p>Then find a peaceful space to sit and be inspired to write your own work surrounded by the poet’s powerful words . This is a casual event, meant to be reflective and focus on encouraging the therapeutic power of the written word.</p>

<p>The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.</p>
