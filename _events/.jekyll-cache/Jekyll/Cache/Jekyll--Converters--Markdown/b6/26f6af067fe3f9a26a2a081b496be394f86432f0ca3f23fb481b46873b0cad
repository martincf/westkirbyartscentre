<h3 id="what-is-keto">What is keto?</h3>

<p>Keto is a diet that works for everybody, following a very simple protocol. A ketogenic diet is not new, it is not a fad diet, and it is not expensive. It is a sustainable, and delightful way of eating that your body will love.</p>

<p>The diet works by forcing your body to use fat instead of ingested carbohydrates for fuel. In a nutshell, you will be losing weight rapidly, with no hunger and you will feel great long-term benefits in a sustainable way.</p>

<p>On top, the byproduct of burning fats are ketones, which are a great source of energy for your brain.</p>
