I"I<p>2020 RUST-O-VISION - NEIL YOUNG’S DEEP CUTS &amp; RARITIES</p>

<p>Neil Young’s body of work is unique in that alongside his well-known ‘hit’s’ is a treasure of obscure album tracks and unreleased gems. These ‘deep cuts’, as they are known, are cherished by his diehard fans, and represent the Holy Grail of Young’s material.</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Neil has recorded and shelved entire albums, and slipped key tracks from them tantalisingly into his set lists. Many have been widely bootlegged and have been the subject of books and magazine articles.</p>

<p>Following four sensational ‘sell-out’ Neil Young-themed concerts, Dean Johnson now presents ‘2020 Rust-O-Vision’, which collects many of the ‘hidden classics’ from the vaults.</p>

<p>The show’s title was coined by Young himself while on his historic ‘Rust Never Sleeps’ Tour in 1979. He stated that if the audience looked hard enough they would witness the artist actually ‘rust’ during the performances. Each ticket holder was issued with their very own ‘Rust-O-Vision’ 3D glasses to assist them in this phenomenon. As far-fetched as it was brilliant, the tour won Neil Young the title of ‘Artist Of The Decade’ by Rolling Stone magazine.</p>

<p>Dean Johnson’s return comes hot on the heels of a triumphant London performance.</p>
