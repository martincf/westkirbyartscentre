I"‚<p>We are pleased to have Wet the Tea back for another great night of live music, for those who have not experienced them yet they are a multi instrument act with Traditional Irish Music roots, with many other influences that creates something different from the norm.</p>

<p>Tonight their special guest is Kate McCullough Music who is a music student at the University of Chester, having a great time making music. I perform acoustic covers from pop to folk to jazz. If Wet the Tea rate her this highly then we can expect a fantastic night.</p>

<p>The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.</p>
