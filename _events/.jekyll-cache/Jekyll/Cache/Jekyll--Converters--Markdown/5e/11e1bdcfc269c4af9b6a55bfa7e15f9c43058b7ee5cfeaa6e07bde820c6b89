I"˜<p>John O‚ÄôConnell is one of Liverpool‚Äôs firm favourites. The remarkable partnership and infectious stage presence he had with the late Graham Evans in Groundpig saw hundreds of people attend their gigs every week. Their musicianship and seemingly endless repertoire from a range of genres had their young fans mesmerised. After the sad passing of Graham, John reinvented himself concentrating his time on his song writing, refining his classical guitar technique and putting on his own concerts. He supported Martin Carthy, Sean Lakeman and toured the UK with the American songwriter Steven Bishop.</p>

<p>Then in 2010 John finally agreed to put on a Dylan only set at the Cavern Club which saw the birth of Simply Dylan. Songs like The Hurricane, Senor and Jokerman were anthems for Groundpig and the gig along with the six subsequent ones all sold out. The success of Simply Dylan which includes opening up the 2019 Isle of Wight Festival, on the Big Top Stage, has been incredible and is what dreams are made of.</p>

<p>Now much to the delight of his Liverpool fans John is dedicating more time to all of his disciplines and going back to his roots. John will be performing one of his eclectic sets at the West Kirby Arts Centre, in April, where he will be playing some original songs along with some classic guitars tunes. Joined by his band the night promises a diverse and engaging set delivered by musicians at the top of their game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äú‚Ä¶everytime I see him, he never ceases to amaze me with his guitar dexterity, (both acoustic and classical), his singing, his song writing and his ability to cover well-known songs to perfection. I mean the ‚ÄòUrban Troubadour‚Äô, otherwise known as John O‚ÄôConnell.‚Äù ‚Äì FOLK NORTH WEST</p>
