I"<p>As part of Wirral International Guitar Festival 2019 we welcome Paul Costello.</p>

<p>Paul has performed, in Europe and the UK, with musicians from the worlds of jazz, classical, folk, and world music. His  solo guitar performances defy easy categorization, weaving together the many strands of his own musical journey, to create music that is beautiful, compelling, and very much his own.</p>

<p>Videos of Paul performing some of the pieces from his album can be found on his website: www.costelloguitar.net/music and on www.youtube.com</p>

<p>The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as ther is no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.</p>
