I"e<p>Corki, ex Wreckless Elbow, will be getting some friends, Will Riding, Carl Southworth and Tennessee waltz together to raise funds for the Tyd-Y-Mon charity which runs the annual ‘Folk on the Farm’.</p>

<p>Deborah and I attended the Festival in 2019 and were so impressed with the value of this wonderful charity that we have chosen them as west kirby Art Centre’s Charity for 2020.  When we invited Corki to put on this fundraising gig he had no hesitation in saying yes and will be putting on a show to remember.</p>

<p>From small beginnings in 2013 the Folk on the Farm festival has quickly established itself as one of the highlights of the folk festival calendar, attracting hundreds each year and featuring some of the best folk artists from around the UK.</p>

<p>Organised each year by Tyddyn Mon, a charity which supports adults with learning disabilities, and Jon Hippy, the festival director, all proceeds from the festival are used to support the charity and its activities.</p>
