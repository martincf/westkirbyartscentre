I"‡<p>Son of Dave is a Bluesman. Not traditional, but has begun a new tradition perhaps. Playing harmonica, layering up beatbox grooves, stomping and playing percussion, then writing passionate growling infectious songs overtop, he defies category. A truly maverick Bluesman.</p>

<p>He comes originally from Winnipeg Canada (born Benjamin Darvill). Heâ€™s been based out of London UK for over twenty years. Heâ€™s toured all over Europe and North America as well as more off-centre countries such as Uganda, South Africa, Lebanon, Russia and more. His one-man show is fun and unforgettable.
Many have come to find Son of Dave tunes through programs like Breaking Bad, Preacher, Bloodline and others where his unique songs have featured.</p>

<p>As a young harmonica player he worked in the Blues and biker bars of Manitoba. Being nurtured in the tradition of Midwest Blues and Canadian folk music, he joined Crash Test Dummies at itâ€™s beginnings and rode that wave for four albums and ten years until returning to his more humble, rhythmic desires and the tunes heâ€™d been working on through those dizzying years. The music business almost crumbled with the switch to digital, but Son found a path through the old fashioned way, playing clubs and building an audience from scratch. Heâ€™s recordings found their way to millions of fans without the backing of a big label or hit machine.</p>

<p>Embarking on a year of singles, EPs and an inevitable 9th album, at 52 years of age, there is no sign of slowing down. Well, the knees an back arenâ€™t what they used to beâ€¦</p>

<p>The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.</p>
