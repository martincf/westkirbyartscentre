I"R<p>Behind the Wall: 2019</p>

<p>Building on the success of her Borrowed Places tour, Miranda Sykes is back with a completely new project: Behind The Wall.</p>

<p>Where Borrowed Places opened a window into the past, explaining where she had been, physically &amp; spiritually, Behind The Wall is a Roller Coaster Ride exploring where we are going; Miranda, you, me, all of us. What does it mean to be human today, living in our communities &amp; societies &amp; where will our actions lead us?
Powerful and hard-hitting but also poignant &amp; beautiful, this show gives us all a chance to reflect &amp; maybe even empower us.</p>

<p>The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Parkfor free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.</p>
