I"í<p>The Mike Smith Quintet</p>

<p>A great night in store to set you up for Christmas with this absolutely stellar jazz lineup.</p>

  <li>Ed Harrison double bass</li>
  <li>Jamie Brownfield trumpet; and,</li>
  <li>Mike Smith on saxophones</li>
</ul>

<p>â€˜Having been brought up in a musical environment, it was inevitable that Mike would make a name for himself as an artist in his own right, but not without earning his spots first.</p>

<p>Mike has paid his dues as a sideman over the last fifteen years with the likes of Elkie Brooks, Tony Hadley, Kid Creole, Heather Small, ABC and Sandi Thom.</p>

<p>In 2016, he was asked to work alongside the international brand CREAM as their sax and keys player for the CREAM CLASSICS tour in 2016-2018 with K-Klass and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>

<p>A musician from the age of 10, he went onto study at the prestigious Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, where he now teaches saxophone.</p>

<p>His diverse and wide ranging experience have given him kudos amongst his peers and he has become one of the most sought after sax players in the area.</p>

<p>Mike has several of his own albums out on the â€˜Ameritzâ€™ record label under his brand name of @gingertunes  <a href="www.gingertunes.co.uk">www.gingertunes.co.uk</a>.</p>
