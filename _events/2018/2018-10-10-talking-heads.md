Library Theatre Touring Companies production of Alan Bennett's 2 Talking Heads

## A Lady of Letters

Miss Ruddock’s civil liberties are dear to her: writing letters is how she asserts her rights.  Not social communications filled with harmless news, but letters of complaint, comment and, occasionally, officious praise to businesses and government departments.
One of these missives pushes her to the brink, with unexpected, but liberating consequences

## Bed Among the Lentils

Susan, a vicar's wife with a fondness for sherry, distracts herself from her  insensitive husband and his doting parishioners by conducting an affair with  Ramesh, discovering something about herself and God in the process.

Library Theatre Touring Company was formed in 1996 with the support of Leeds Libraries  - hence the name. The company initially played several small local Leeds venues- including libraries and following this success, toured widely with the aim of taking professional, accessible and entertaining theatre to the community.

As well as working extensively for the Welsh Arts Council, the company has toured the Scottish Borders, performed in Norfolk, Teesside, Nottinghamshire, Cumbria and of course Yorkshire.,

We play village halls, community centres, pubs, hotels, schools and small theatres. We run four plays concurrently and aim to provide an enjoyable entertaining evening at a very competitive cost

Debbie Kelly who performs in ‘2 Talking Heads’ has played several roles for the company and at present, as well as performing ‘Talking Heads’ plays ‘Angela’ in ‘My Brilliant Divorce’ – a delightful one woman show which ran in the West End with Dawn French.

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Parkfor free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
