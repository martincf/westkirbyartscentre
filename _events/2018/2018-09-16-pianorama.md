West Kirby Arts Centre needs a new piano.

Leading and emerging pianists from the region will play for 5 hours to raise money for a new piano for the West Kirby Arts Centre. The Arts Centre is a real hub for performance, educational activities and charitable fund-raising. A new piano would enhance all of these activities and facilitate new ones.
