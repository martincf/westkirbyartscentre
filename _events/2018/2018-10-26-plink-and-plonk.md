The crazy Summer Strum Ukelele fanatics are at it again planning for their 5th Annual Summer Strum in 2019.  

All profits from the event are donated to Wirral St John's Hospice, Wirral Mind and Maggies Merseyside at Clatterbridge so lets help them get the ball rolling with a night of music, cheese and wine (what's not to like?)

Music from the 'Broken Strings' band and the wonderful Rosie Wright with Somelier James Gillespie presenting an array of fine wines for your pleasure and delight.

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Parkfor free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
