The annual charity event returns to raise funds for the UTS Foundation and CHICS (Children's Cancer Support Group). Local musicians will attempt to play live the finest pop songs of the era, taking you on a musical journey from post-punk, synth pop and new wave, to the stadium anthems of Queen, Bowie and U2. Featuring Alex Riley, Glyn Jones and Ian McGaw.

The UTS Foundation in Hoylake aims to change the lives of the most vulnerable people in our community. It provides accessible and free structured coaching, health and well-being sessions to vulnerable community groups across the Wirral.

The Children's Cancer Support Group is based in the North West of the UK, covering Merseyside, the Wirral, North Wales and West Cheshire.
