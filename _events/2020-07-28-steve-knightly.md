We are pleased to be able to present Steve Knightley with West Kirby Arts Centre online concert

Enjoy your very own gig in the comfort of your own home!  Steve will perform a full concert on YouTube, followed by an optional ‘meet & greet’ session afterwards using Zoom.

The performance will start at 8pm on YouTube and Steve will perform two x 45 minute sets.  There will be a short interval of 10 minutes after the first set so that you can refill your glasses!  After the show there will be an optional ‘meet and greet’ session with Steve via Zoom, so you can have a chat and ask questions if you wish.

Tickets are £20.00 per household, allowing any number of people in you residence to watch the show.

Full details of how to access the gig will be provided 48 hours before the gig.  Please note you will not need to download any software for the YouTube gig, but you will need Zoom to take part in the after show chat if you want to join in.  A private YouTube access link will be provided to each email address that purchases a ’slot’.
