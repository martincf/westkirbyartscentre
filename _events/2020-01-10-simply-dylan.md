For one night only John O’Connell, formerly GROUNDPIG, will be playing a SIMPLY DYLAN acoustic set at West Kirby Arts Centre. No frills, no gimmicks, no pretence Simply Dylan is John’s personal interpretation of the songs of one of the world’s most prodigious song writers, Bob Dylan. Joined by some of his band members John will be covering a wide range of songs from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. From a modest project celebrating Dylan’s 70th Birthday Simply Dylan has gone from selling out the Cavern Club 6 times, to receiving fantastic reviews from the Spanish Press, to impressing Dylan fans from across the UK on their theatre tours with SJM Concerts.

Last summer they performed at 'The Isle of Wight Festival' their biggest gig to date.
This special night is a warm up for their 2020 tour which this year takes in the Auditorium
at the Liverpool Arena and so will be Simply Dylan's smallest gig in 2020.
