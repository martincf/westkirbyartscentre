Ollie West and his band return for a second visit to the Arts Centre as part of his national tour 2019. We are pleased to welcome back an up and coming young singer songwriter.

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as there is no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
