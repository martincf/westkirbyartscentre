# A big heading
Join with **A Fistful of Spookies** (UK) for a two hour vocal workshop. It is bound to be a fantastic event and accessible for all singers, male and female, all abilities.

## A smaller heading
Don't miss out on this taste of __Spooky Man__ magic! If a workshop is not enough, take a look at the combined ticket on the site for workshop and evening concert (7pm - 10pm)for £20

### An even smaller heading
Use double asterisks **for bold text** or double underscores for __italic text__.

#### Things to get right:
- The file name has to be exactly the same format as I've provided: event date in the form of YYYY-MM-DD-event-title.md – replace 'event-title' with the event tile, no spaces.
- The list of data between the three dashes above is very important. You won't need to change: layout, that's always the same.
- The 'bookable' data, if yes, simply means it'll be booked through Worldpay. If 'no', then you need to add the website address to the other booking system being used. Add the website address in the 'organiser_url' below 'bookable'.
- The 'date' data needs to be the same format as the file name: YYYY-MM-DD
- The 'image' data needs to be the name of the image file being used for the event, ensuring there are no spaces used in the filename
- The 'permalink' data is the name of the website page address on the website, no spaces – make it short and simple if possible.
- The published data is for me to turn the event off after it's finished
