The Wilfred Owen Story (housed within the West Kirby Arts Centre) is celebrating this year's National Poetry day (Oct 3rd) with a creative writing event.

Come and join our resident poets J.E.Wilder and Christine Purcell, as they examine some of Owen's poetry.

Then find a peaceful space to sit and be inspired to write your own work surrounded by the poet's powerful words . This is a casual event, meant to be reflective and focus on encouraging the therapeutic power of the written word.


The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
