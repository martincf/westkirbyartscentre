We are pleased to host the first Americana Social fundraiser for Wirral Wave Community Radio featuring John Jenkins and The Jame's Street Band with support from Daniel Bibby.

John Jenkins is not only a Wirral Wave's but also a firm Liverpool favourite, well known and loved from his appearances around the city with his James Street Band. John has recently signed to Fretsore Records and is definitely a local artist on the rise.

Daniel Bibby will be the first act of the night. Daniel is a favourite of the Americana Social writing songs oozing with honesty and emotion.

With your ticket not only will you get to see and support two great local acts you'll also be supporting Wirral Wave Radio. Wirral Wave Radio is a community interest company privately funded with no commercial breaks and no commercial sponsors.
