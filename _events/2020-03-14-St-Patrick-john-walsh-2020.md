John Walsh, Keith Price and Barbara Hough help us celebrate 
St Patrick's night in fine style. 

This is always a popular night so be sure to book early. 

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
