"The finest country rock band on the planet" - Mojo

"One of California's unique treasures" - Dave Alvin

"To say that I See Hawks in L.A. traipse down a going-their-own-way path through that old folky Americana and classic California country rock thing doesn't quite begin to describe the sheer scope of this band's wiiide open vision. They're adding much-needed musical and lyrical complexity to the old forms, blending and stretching both the emotional and sonic terrain to thrillingly new and unfamiliar points beyond. Hear it for y'self to best effect yet on the band's new Mystery Drug, another wickedly surreal blast of psychedelicized country and poetic honkytonk chops." - John Payne, L.A. Weekly

"An ensemble with a serious pedigree in California's roots-rock scene. They earn marks before playing a note for a song called 'I Fell In Love With The Grateful Dead' but it's a key signifier. The spirit owes something to Workingman's Dead / American Beauty but even more to the Dead's 1981 live acoustic 'Reckoning'. Waller's rich baritone and some smart, sharp and decidedly dark lyrics provide the cherry on the Garcis" - Uncut

The Band will be featuring material from their latest CD "Live and Never Learn" which sees the band on top form "The human problems that life throws up and that everyone faces from time to time weave their way through the lyrics, from the title track through "White Cross' to 'Stoned with Melissa' and 'The Last Man in Tujunga' there's a visceral edge that quite simply pulls you into their songs." Tom Franks, Folk Words

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Parkfor free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
