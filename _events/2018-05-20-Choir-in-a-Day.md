Come and experience the joy of singing at this one-day workshop, Songs of the Sea Special, in the beautiful acoustics of West Kirby Arts Centre.

Led by experienced vocal practitioner James Sills, you will learn a variety of traditional and contemporary songs from around the world in 3/4 part harmony. All songs will be taught by ear and no previous experience is necessary - just enthusiasm!
