When not donning the tricorn hat with the Blue Buccaneers, Tom Mason tours as a solo act, entertaining crowds with his guitar and dobro playing, his musical story-telling, and songs from his recent solo CD "Salmagundi", an anthology of his non-nautical tunes like "I Thought I Heard a Train", "Chano Pozo's Shoes", "The World is Drunk", and a good bit of slide guitar.

Be forewarned, though, his solo shows stray from the typical shoe-gazing sensitive singer-songwriter fare, owing as much to Vaudeville as Nashville.
