Bullets and Daffodils concession rates

Over 65's and Studants all £12.50.

This is the final time that this musical will be played, here is some of it's history:

“The Floral Pavilion show was very poignant,” explains the writer Dean Johnson, “New Brighton was a favourite haunt of Wilfred and his family. He learnt to swim and horse ride there, so performing so close to where he actually played was very moving.”

Bullets and Daffodils premiered in 2011 at Birkenhead Central Library, and went on to enjoy runs in London's West End, and was also the subject of a BBC documentary film.
