This unique retelling of Dickens' heart warming tale told through an array of folk
instruments, old and new, with authentic musical arrangements, brims with warmth, wit and wonder.

A magical retelling using traditional midwinter English folk tunes and carol
melodies to illustrate the transformation of flinty-hearted Ebenezer Scrooge into the
epitome of the Christmas spirit - warm-hearted, generous and loving.

Uplifting and melodic, Green Matthews A Christmas Carol recaptures the simple Yuletide
delights of fellowship, laughter and good cheer.
