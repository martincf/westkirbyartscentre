Fresh from their UK Tour Simply Dylan return to one of their favourite venues WKAC. John will be trying out some new Dylan songs with the band so be prepared for an exciting preview of their future shows.

As straightforward as the title suggests: No frills, no gimmicks, no pretence; Simply Dylan is John O'Connell's personal exploration and celebration of the rich and diverse work of Bob Dylan.

It is the band’s precise playing and high energy renditions that have gone from a modest project recognising Dylan's 70th Birthday in 2011 to selling out the Cavern Club 6 times, to opening the 2019 Isle of Wight Festival to receiving fantastic reviews from audiences across the UK

John O'Connell, formerly of Groundpig who leads Simply Dylan, has collaborated with other highly reputable musicians to form his Dylan Band. They explore Dylan’s diverse work and bring his lyrical content to life; in doing so have ignited a new wave of passion for one of the world’s most prodigious song writers.

>“…the night belonged to SIMPLY DYLAN and the genius of John O'Connell. Together, they marry the extraordinary range and beauty of Dylan's lyrics with a joyous and exuberant, celebratory sound." – Alan Bleasdale (Playwright)
