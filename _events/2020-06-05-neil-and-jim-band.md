We are pleased to announce that the acclaimed American roots band - the Nell & Jim Band - will be playing West Kirby Arts Centre as part of their tour of Europe in June and July 2020. They have festivals and shows in the UK, Germany and Poland.

Here's what people are saying:

> â€œWe loved their show! Their crossover bluegrass, jazz, California style of music was a real hit with our audience!" - La Roche Bluegrass Festival

This band collectively has played nearly every major bluegrass and folk festival in North America. Jim Nunally and Jim Kerwin bring decades of experience in the David Grisman Bluegrass Experience and Quintet, plus Nunally's performance on Juno and Grammy Award-winning albums. Nell Robinson has been featured on A Prairie Home Companion, the Kennedy Center, and two PBS music specials, including her album Rose Of No Man's Land produced by Joe Henry.

From Vancouver Folk Festival to Northwest Folk Life and Folk Alliance International to Fresh Grass Music Festival, Rogue Folk Club, Claremont Folk Music Center, Victoria Folk Society, National Veterans Art Museum, La Roche Bluegrass Festival and many more...

The Nell & Jim Band bring together virtuoso artists and original, bluegrass-inspired music. Featuring Jim Nunally on guitar, banjo and vocals, Nell Robinson on flute & vocals, Jim Kerwin on bass fiddle & harmonies, Alex Aspinall on percussion, Rob Reich on accordion & keyboards, this is truly an all-star band.
