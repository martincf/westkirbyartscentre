The music of Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, The Wainwrights, Leonard Cohen, KD Lang, Gordon Lightfoot and many more.

I have been listening to and have been noticeably influenced by all of these Singer-songwriters throughout my career as a musician and have always been amazed by the unique sense of honesty and deep collective integrity that music from Canada possesses; a natural embodiment of human awareness that has caressed the country’s songwriters over many decades.

Keith James brings you a concert of this amazing material in the most emotional and sensitive way:

After the Gold Rush, Harvest, The Circle Game, Big Yellow Taxi, Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk, Suzanne, Famous Blue Raincoat, Constant Craving, If You could read my Mind are all in this concert.
