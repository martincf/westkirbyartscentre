The Mike Smith Quintet

A great night in store to set you up for Christmas with this absolutely stellar jazz lineup.

- Jack Cotterill drums
- Tom Stichbury guitar
- Ed Harrison double bass
- Jamie Brownfield trumpet; and,
- Mike Smith on saxophones

'Having been brought up in a musical environment, it was inevitable that Mike would make a name for himself as an artist in his own right, but not without earning his spots first.   

Mike has paid his dues as a sideman over the last fifteen years with the likes of Elkie Brooks, Tony Hadley, Kid Creole, Heather Small, ABC and Sandi Thom.

In 2016, he was asked to work alongside the international brand CREAM as their sax and keys player for the CREAM CLASSICS tour in 2016-2018 with K-Klass and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.  

A musician from the age of 10, he went onto study at the prestigious Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, where he now teaches saxophone.

His diverse and wide ranging experience have given him kudos amongst his peers and he has become one of the most sought after sax players in the area.   

Mike has several of his own albums out on the 'Ameritz' record label under his brand name of @gingertunes  [www.gingertunes.co.uk](www.gingertunes.co.uk).


Also featuring Classic vinyl from Mono-Tone
