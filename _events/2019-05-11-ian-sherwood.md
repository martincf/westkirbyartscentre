We are pleased to be welcoming Ian Sherwood to West Kirby Arts Centre.

Named “Male Artist of the Year” by the International Acoustic Music Awards, plus Music Nova Scotia’s “Musician of the Year”, Ian Sherwood's music has been described as “traditional singer/songwriter style at its essence.” Stylish is certainly a good word to describe his performance.

Ian plays guitar and saxophone and if you are wondering how he manages to play both instruments at the same time, well with clever use of looping pedals he pulls it off superbly, making for an extremely full and entertaining show. As the Maverick reviewer put it, “Sherwood used it so well it did not feel like a gimmick.” His performance is full of energy; he’s a bit of a one-man-band actually. He’s also really charming and so obviously feels at home on the stage and loves to engage with the audience.

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
