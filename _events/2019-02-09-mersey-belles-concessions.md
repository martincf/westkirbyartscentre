Mersey Belles are proud to announce the launch of Belles & Beaus and invite you to join us in celebration of this exciting new ensemble.

The Mersey Belles have been adored by audiences and fellow ukulele players since they began entertaining in 2012. With repertoire alternating between vintage favourites and retro-infused pop classics. The duo have played most of the UK ukulele festivals as well as Finland, Prague, Austria, Scotland and Ireland, also providing vocal workshops with an inclusive feel-good style. They have provided bespoke shows for Google, Volkswagen, O2, Sky and BMW and UK Parliament.

For this debut evening, Danielle and Rosie double the duo with Liam and Ged, presenting an unprecedented combination of four-stringed fabulousness, Belles & Beaus. A variety evening of solos, duos and of course, Mersey Belles. Each member of Belles & Beaus brings a lifetime of musical passion, talent and experience, plus a diverse background of musical tastes and techniques to merge into a foursome founded in friendship.

Free glass of bubbles for first twenty tickets sold!
