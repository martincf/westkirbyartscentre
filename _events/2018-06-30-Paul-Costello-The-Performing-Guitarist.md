The Performing Guitarist: This workshop, presented by Paul Costello, is for classical and acoustic guitarists, at all levels, who wish to become more confident performers.

You will learn how to prepare for an upcoming show or exam, practise effectively, and memorise new pieces. We will examine issues relating to tone production, and establishing a good rhythmic feel, exploring the mental, physical, and emotional keys to confident, expressive performing.

Subjects covered will include visualisation, focusing attention, relaxation, physical posture, and dealing with performance nerves. You will be given practical strategies and exercises that provide real and lasting benefits, and plenty of time to discuss individual questions.
