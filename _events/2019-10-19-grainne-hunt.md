Gráinne Hunt’s New Album This Secret is released on 20th September, and single Let Go comes out in support of that on the 6th September.  

> “I’ve been working on these songs for ages, but it was only recently that I had time to record it!”.

In a whirlwind Nashville session last October, Gráinne recorded eleven tracks in just under three days.

> “It just felt really easy,” she muses. “I'd never recorded like that before, but it was an incredible way to do it - and a lovely way to catch a snapshot of a moment in time.”

It has certainly been a busy few years for Gráinne and has lead to an impressive array of solo shows, including two nights opening for Gladys Knight at Dublin’s Olympia Theatre, Eagle Eye Cherry, and a festival appearance at Glastonbury.

Gráinne has gained a reputation as an outstanding vocalist, touring internationally with Mark Geary, and has shared stages with Glen Hansard, Liam Ó Maonlaí and Damien Dempsey.

Following on from her first solo release in 2015, Firing Pin, Gráinne released an Irish songs and ballads album earlier this year with award winning guitarist Brendan Walsh, called Songs from Ireland.

This is Gráinne’s first full length EP.
