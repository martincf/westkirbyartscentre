November 2018 sees the centenary of the end of World War 1, but more poignantly, it marks 100 years since the death of locally-educated war poet Wilfred Owen. Wilfred attended the Birkenhead Institute School, as did Wirral musician Dean Johnson, the writer of this stage musical dedicated to Owen.

When it premiered, Bullets and Daffodils was the worldâ€™s first musical stage production to be based on the war poetry of Wilfred Owen. This very special farewell performance was commissioned by the Rt Hon Frank Field MP, and stars actor Nicholas Ball, legendary for his portrayal of James Hazell in the iconic 70's detective series Hazell, who is currently gracing our screens in the medical drama Holby City. Nicholas is visiting West Kirby especially for this production, and is quite possibly the highest calibre artist ever to perform in the area.

The show recasts Wilfred Owen's poems as contemporary songs, whilst the script contains contributions from Dr Who writer David Quantick and music from Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.

The show was the subject of a BBC documentary, following its development from Birkenhead to London's West End. All 3 singles released from the show have received airplay on BBC Radio 2.

This final performance is part of the Wilfred Owen 100 commemorations.

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Parkfor free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
