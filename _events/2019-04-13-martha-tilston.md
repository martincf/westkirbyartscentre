“Sharp, original songs that dissect the modern world.She captures both the harshness and enchantment of life” - Guardian

With a voice like spider-webbed hollows and lyrics that inspire and captivate, Martha has earned anomination from the BBC for best newcomer and released seven albums to date on her own label Squiggly Records building up a large audience worldwide.

Martha has played main stage spots at festivals including Glastonbury Acoustic stage, the Australian National Folk festival among others. She has toured with the likes of Damien Rice and she has also featured on the Zero 7 album ‘Yeah Ghost’.

Martha’s vibrant upbringing was both musical and artistic. In London with her artist mother and theatredirector stepfather, there was always late-night piano sessions, Joni Mitchell or Leonard Cohen spinning on the record player and creative chaos everywhere. But in Bristol her singer-songwriter father Steve Tilston and folk singer Maggie Boyle (step-mother) influenced her musical ear. 

he would often find legendary musicians like Bert Jansch, John Renbourn gathered and singing in the familykitchen. It was perhaps no wonder that all these textures fed into her creativity and emergence of Martha as a powerful songstress in her own right.

With her beautiful crystal clear vocals, Martha’s musical arrangements range from the pinhead intimacy of acoustic guitar and voice to the expansive electric, slide guitar, rolling beats, deep bass, banjo, string arrangements and sometimes touches of electronica.

The new album NOMAD will invite you to make a fire outside under the stars, Look up at a big green moon, fly over a world of robots and humans... and to never dwell on the path not taken.
