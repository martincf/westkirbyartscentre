West Kirby Arts Centre needs a new piano.

Leading and emerging pianists from the region will play for 5 hours to raise money for a new piano for the West Kirby Arts Centre. The Arts Centre is a real hub for performance, educational activities and charitable fund-raising. A new piano would enhance all of these activities and facilitate new ones.

Free entry, donations requested, licensed bar.

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
