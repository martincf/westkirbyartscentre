The Edgelarks fly in on the tailwind of BBC award winning duo, Phillip Henry and Hannah Martin.

The pairs new project takes the roots of their previous work, from the traditional musics of the British Isles to Indian classical slide guitar to the stomping roots party of Phil's beatbox harmonica; adds a strong stem of original writing; and runs wilder with each repeat play.
