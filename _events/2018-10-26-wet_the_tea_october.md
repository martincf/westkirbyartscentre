Wet the Tea is Andy Connally, Andy Saunders and Ciaran Burke.

They are all musicians who have traditional Irish Music roots that were formed in the Liverpool Irish Centre through Comhaltas. Andy Connally plays the flute, whistles, piano and guitar along with providing the vocals. Andy Saunders plays the banjo, bouzouki, mandolin and tenor guitar. Ciaran Burke plays the bodhran and cajon.

Together they blend traditional influences with a modern twist. Tune sets range from haunting slow airs through to blistering reels. Whilst the songs move through traditional Irish, folk, country and more,  Wet the Tea will take you through an interesting musical journey.

We're hoping this will become a regular residency to show case special guests as well as Wet the Tea. Please come down and support if you can... it'll be great seeing you.

Wet the Tea will have a special guest playing with them to make it up to a four piece for the second spot. His name is Rachard Hayden and is a fantastic tenor guitar player.

The venue is situated on Brookfield Gardens in the site of the old Unitarian Church. Licensed bar available. Parkfor free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse as no on street parking. Only 4 minutes walk away.
