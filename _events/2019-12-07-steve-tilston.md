We welcome Steve Tilston back for his 4th visit to the Arts Centre, he has helped us build a reputation for great nights with great musicians. This is your chance to see one of the great folk singer songwriters of the last 50 years.

Steve is one of our most celebrated song smiths, widely recognised within the world of folk and contemporary music; the words, arrangements and subtle, quite superb guitar playing could be no one else.

> “The more you listen, the more there is to discover.” Bob Harris

Fatea Awards Male Vocalist of the Year 2015, proof if needed, that after more than 45 years in the business Steve can still deliver the goods; Truth to Tell one of The Telegraph’s best folk albums of 2015 too.

Released July 2018… Distant Days a paired back voice and guitar recording; nineteen tracks - solo acoustic recollections or musical markers in the diary, chosen largely by public selection, plus a trio of previously unrecorded tunes.

The writer of such classic songs as The Slipjigs and Reels and the award-winning The Reckoning. He’s toured with John Renbourn’s Ship of Fools, traditional singer Maggie Boyle (the classic recordings Of Moor and Mesa and All Under the Sun), as guitarist with Ballet Rambert, with Maartin Allcock & Pete Zorn in WAZ! with Brooks Williams and with his daughter Martha. Plus collaborations with alt-country band The Durbervilles and old Bristol pals Keith Warmington and Stuart Gordon as the Steve Tilston Trio.

Others have also recorded Steve’s songs. Here’s to Tom Paine is the adopted theme song for the Tom Paine Society of America and we’ve lost count of the number of versions of The Slipjigs & Reels!

The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs.
Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.
