The Ciderhouse Rebellion is an exciting new duo bringing together two seasoned musicians: violinist Adam Summerhayes and master accordionist Murray Grainger.

The pair play traditional tunes, particularly from the North East, write their own music and specialise in creating within the moment – each performance is uniquely magical in its improvisatory focus.

During lock down they have been releasing weekly broadcasts on Facebook and YouTube – firstly The InCider Sessions and as lockdown eased a little The OutCider Sessions.

> 'I became utterly bewitched by the beauty of what Summerhayes and Grainger had created. It could justifiably be described as a folk symphony, possessing cyclical completeness yet creating a form that is, at once, both elemental and pastoral.' – Fatea Magazine

> 'A work of startling, immediate beauty' – Folk Radio UK
