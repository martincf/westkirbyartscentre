The Celebrated are the West Kirby Arts Centre house band with a core group of five musicians (Bob Glass, Glyn Jones, Craig Mackintosh, Gareth Padfield and Trevor Smith) formed in 2015 to perform concerts to raise money for charities and have been doing so ever since, with many invited guest musicians. The ‘Strike Another Match Concert’ concert will be their 16th performed at the West Kirby Arts Centre.

The theme for this concert comes from the 1965 song ‘It’s All Over Now Baby Blue’. Dylanologists have attempted to explain what the Nobel laureate is singing about, but The Celebrated like to think the penultimate line in the song - 'strike another match go start anew’ - could be referring to Hans Christian Anderson’s Little Match Girl, who struck her matches to keep warm, but the striking matches also enabled her to imagine wonderful visions of how life might be.

Their charity for the Strike Another Match Concert is [MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES](https://www.msf.org.uk) (Doctors Without Borders) - the world’s leading emergency medical humanitarian aid organisation. We hope you enjoy their music and please give generously for this incredibly worthwhile cause.
