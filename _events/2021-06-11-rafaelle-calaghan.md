Raphael Callaghan has made his mark on the Merseyside blues scene over many years, guesting on harmonica with such greats as Bonnie Raitt, Alexis Korner, Eric Bibb and Jo Ann Kelly.

He returns to WKAC with songs from his new album, Blue Lies, his latest collection of originals in his own personal brand of blues. Expect vocal wizardry, stellar slide guitar and compulsive grooves. Maverick open tunings underpin lyrics that can hit like a hammer or move you to tears.
