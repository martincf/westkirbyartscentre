## Local stars bring Wilfred Owen musical to the big screen.

Radio Merseyside legend Billy Butler and former Brookside actor Dean Sullivan are the stars of the forthcoming movie version of the Wilfred Owen musical Bullets and Daffodils. Four years in the making, it captures a live performance of the show filmed at New Brighton's Floral Pavilion in 2014. Created by Wirral songwriter Dean Johnson and the award-winning producer Mal Robinson, it comes to the big screen next month and will be simultaneously streamed worldwide via the internet.

Dean Sullivan, famous for his iconic portrayal of lovable rogue Jimmy Corkhill, directed the original stage version and also features as Owen's hero and mentor Siegfried Sassoon. Billy Butler, who has one of the most recognisable voices in Merseyside history, reads the part of an ‘everyday’ soldier ‘Tommy’.

The film is the prelude to an impressive festival of commemoration taking place across the Wirral this November in honour of Wilfred's memory. Bullets and Daffodils was at the forefront of promoting the Birkenhead-educated war poet's links to the Wirral. Owen's boyhood in the town is explored in the production that also features the voice of ‘James Herriot’ actor Christopher Timothy. Pink Floyd's David Gilmour was an early supporter of the show and gave permission for his music to be included gratis.

The special gala screening will be held at The West Kirby Arts Centre. Admission will be free, but a donation to the Wilfred Owen Story Museum is requested.

“The Floral Pavilion show was very poignant,” explains the writer Dean Johnson, “New Brighton was a favourite haunt of Wilfred and his family. He learnt to swim and horse ride there, so performing so close to where he actually played was very moving.”

Bullets and Daffodils premiered in 2011 at Birkenhead Central Library, and went on to enjoy runs in London's West End, and was also the subject of a BBC documentary film.
