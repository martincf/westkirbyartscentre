WKAC Christmas food bank concert. Entry will be by donation of a bag of food or toiletries, check our facebook page for further details.

Looking forward to our annual concert raising much needed food and toiletries for the local food bank.

Local music hero Dean Johnson will perform his recent release "The Last of the Sky" an album that has had over a million streams in the USA and still counting.

Dean says of the concert that he will be performing
'Songs of environmental empathy & and social conscience to help put some food on the table and the mind.'

This will be Dean's last live performance for some time due to personal commitments, so come along and enjoy what will be a memorable West Kirby Arts Centre night.
