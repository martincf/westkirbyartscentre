Robbie Burns’ Immortal Memory and his legacy for the makers of cider in the Wirral

Wirral Pomona mark Robbie Burns’ Immortal Memory and his legacy for the makers of cider.

This roughly takes the form of a Burns Supper, at West Kirby ARTS CENTRE. We had our first event like this four years ago we thought then that the Arts Centre looked like the kirk in Burns’ Tam O’Shanter, where the patrons were behaving in a way you wouldn’t expect in a church. This coming ceilidh will be just as lively and friendly

The Supper gives us a chance to raise a few funds, taste our cider from last year, but mostly to hold a convivial celebration to balance with the hard work which has been involved over the last 6 months in building up the equipment, resources and expertise, cleaning, scratting, pressing, bottling, organising, sampling and tasting. We also help Wirral Tree Wardens in protecting trees, including the demonstration orchard at Brimstage which has been under threat in the last 2 years.

It’ll be seasonal, lots of food and drink, live music with Rosie as dance caller for the barn dance with Scots, Irish and English Country dance elements which have proved great fun and surprisingly easy to join in. Music, song and dance calling is provided by Jo Pue, John Walsh, Rosie Wright and special guest Anita Rockford with guests and by Melody Makers who meet at Melrose Hall every Wednesday lunch-time. We have a maximum of 80 tickets to sell, which will pay for the fees and expenses and earn us enough, we hope, to pay for any extra bits we need.,

Ticket prices: £10.00 to include A Burns Supper Menu Children 6-16: reduced price of £5.00 (those 5 and under will not be charged.)

We’ll post the full menu nearer the time: it’ll probably have haggis but will have vegan and other alternatives.
