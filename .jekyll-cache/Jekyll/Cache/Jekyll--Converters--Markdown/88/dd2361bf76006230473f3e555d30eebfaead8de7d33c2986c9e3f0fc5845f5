I"²<p>The Songs of Leonard Cohen. These remarkable songs -Â stripped back, desolate, naked and sensual.</p>

<p>Enigmatic, mysterious and sub-textural, songwriter Leonard Cohen was an unflinching character, with an exact sense of prose, wry humour and the courage to wrestle with the unspoken, forgiving human frailty with the stroke of each line.</p>

<p>The chilling announcement of Leonardâ€™s death marked the end of an era. His music befriended an entire generation.Â Within every line of his writing, he has been challenging us to listen more carefully, speak more thoughtfully, think more deeply and recognise our own fragility. Our World misses him very much.</p>

<p>With a lifetime reputation of performing in this exact way and an undying love of the â€˜pure songâ€™ Keith James gives you a concert of Cohenâ€™s amazing material in the most intimate and sensitive way imaginable, exposing the solitary inner strength of his greatest songs in their original perfect form. Keith has performed an extensive tour of this concert in Theatres and Arts Centres across the UK, giving almost 500 concerts â€“ close to 150,000 people. This has proved to be one of the greatest honours in Keith Jamesâ€™ 40 year career. Keith lives in Powys, Wales and Andalusia, Spain.</p>

<p>Included in the concert are Cohenâ€™s well known songs: Famous Blue Raincoat, Sisters of Mercy, Suzanne and Hallelujah alongside his rarer and profound writing such as Who by Fire, Joan of Arc and Secret Life. Also included are songs from his posthumous album Thanks for the Dance and Keithâ€™s dramatic performances based on the work of Federico Garcia Lorca â€“ Cohenâ€™s greatest influence.</p>

<p>Keith has also transcribed into song one of Leonardâ€™s poems from his collection â€˜Book of longingâ€™ written whilst on retreat during the 1990s.</p>
