I"B<p>Tim Chu and Ian Bailey are two talented professional singer-songwriters from the North West of England.They have grown up listening to Simon &amp; Garfunkel’s music with both the composition and vocal blend having a strong influence on their respective professional careers.</p>

<p>After years of busy individual touring schedules both Tim and Ian have now found the time to concentrate on this venture delivering the music of Simon and Garfunkel in their own unique way that also honours the original recordings, without falling into the regular tribute act category.  There are no costumes, wigs or make up!</p>

<p>Just two great musicians producing an ambient collection of some of Simon &amp; Garfunkel’s
much loved hits.</p>

<p>The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.</p>
