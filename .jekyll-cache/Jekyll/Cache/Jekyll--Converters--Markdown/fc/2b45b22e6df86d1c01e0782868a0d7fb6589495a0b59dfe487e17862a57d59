I"`<p>If you missed this one last year here is your chance to experience the wonderful combination of Tennessee Waltz with the Helsby Mountain String band. A foot stomping, banjo flailing, frantic fiddle playing mayhem of Country, Bluegrass and Americana.</p>

<p>The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.</p>
