I"Å<p>The late Jake Thackray is being increasingly acknowledged as one of the greatest English songwriters of the twentieth century, a unique talent, whose songs are full of humour,
poetry, wit, irreverence and humanity â€“ often all at the same time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€˜Long may John continue to keep Jakeâ€™s memory alive so skilfullyâ€™ â€“Â Sir Richard Stilgoe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Watterson is Jakeâ€™s biographer and the UKâ€™s leading performer of Jakeâ€™s songs. As Fake Thackray he has toured with Fairport Convention, played at many festivals, theatres, clubs and on national radio. John has recently uncovered 15 wonderful songs written by Jake but never released â€“ some have lain forgotten in the BBC archives for decades, others found in Jakeâ€™s personal papers have never been heard at all.</p>

<p>These songs, along with never-before told stories from the biography research plus several much-loved Jake classics, feature in Johnâ€™s new show â€“ a hilarious and captivating celebration the life and songs of one of this countryâ€™s finest and funniest wordsmiths.</p>

<p>â€˜Highly entertaining whether you are discovering Jake for the first time, or an ardent fanâ€™</p>

<p>â€œJake would have loved the skill, the accuracy and the affection it contains.
But he would have been utterly baffled that anyone would have written a tribute to him.
One of Jakeâ€™s many unique qualities was that the word flattery was completely absent from
his otherwise huge vocabulary. Long may John continue to keep Jakeâ€™s memory alive so
affectionately and skilfully and introduce more people to one of the most remarkable
talents I ever met.â€</p>

<p>I am sure Jake would be delighted with Johnâ€™s interpretations and I hope this show succeeds
in its ambition of bringing Jake Thackrayâ€™s brilliant songs to a new audience.â€</p>

<p>â€˜John is totally engaging; his show is full of fun and rich in detail about Jakeâ€™s life
and music. Johnâ€™s enthusiasm and love of Jake is infectious, and his interpretation is
exceptional. He brings the great man back to life. John â€˜s voice and guitar playing are
superb and his sense of comic timing is brilliant.  I have never seen an audience laughing
so much!â€™</p>

<p>â€˜Itâ€™s wonderful to hear songs by the inimitable Jake Thackray we simply hadnâ€™t known about,
and to hear them so close to how he might have performed themâ€¦â€‹â€™</p>

<p>â€˜John Wattersonâ€™s joy in performing Jakeâ€™s wonderful songs is obvious. My dear friend Jake
was a modest and shy man, but I think he would be quietly grinning in approvalâ€¦
a wonderful celebration of the life and work of a unique and sadly missed artist.â€™</p>
