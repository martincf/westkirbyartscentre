I"ø<p>We welcome back one of our favourite acts Edgelarks</p>

<p>Born from the work of the duo Phillip Henry and Hannah Martin, Edgelarks combine exquisite folk with influences as diverse as the blues and Indian classical slide guitar, to create a sound that is</p>

  <p>â€œSubtle, atmospheric and bravely originalâ€ â€“Â The Guardian</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The BBC Folk Award winners take their strong roots sound, mixing original song writing with stomping beatbox harmonica, soaring fiddle and vocal harmonies, running wilder with each repeat play.</p>

<p>A busy collaborative period has included work as part of the Gigspanner Big Band (featuring members of Bellowhead and Steeleye Span); and performing at BBC Radio Twoâ€™s Festival In A Day to a Hyde Park crowd of 50,000 - supporting Kylie Minogue!</p>

<p>Now they are back on the road with their formidable live show, making much more noise than only two people should be able to, taking audiences on a story telling journey around a new musical landscape.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œExtraordinaryâ€¦I was blown away by them!â€ â€“Â Tom Robinson, BBC 6 Music</p>
