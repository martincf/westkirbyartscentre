I"ª<p>Regan Wrea and his band. Borth on guitar, Gibbo on bass, and Jack on drums.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been writing songs since I was a young teen, and released a handful on Spotify last year, I have recently finished my first EP (releasing in march) all produced and recorded in my bedroom. I have been trying to my peace in life with music and my mission is to keep helping people find their own peace in my music, Iâ€™ve been playing gigs over Liverpool last year and continue to do the same for 2020</p>

<p>The EP is called Tidal Reach, it took me about 7 months to complete, the name is taken from a house on Caldy Beach and itâ€™s my first REACH to my style and the  beach vibes.</p>
