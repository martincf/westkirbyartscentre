I"ç<p>The Ciderhouse Rebellion is an exciting new duo bringing together two seasoned musicians: violinist Adam Summerhayes and master accordionist Murray Grainger.</p>

<p>The pair play traditional tunes, particularly from the North East, write their own music and specialise in creating within the moment â€“ each performance is uniquely magical in its improvisatory focus.</p>

<p>During lock down they have been releasing weekly broadcasts on Facebook and YouTube â€“ firstly The InCider Sessions and as lockdown eased a little The OutCider Sessions.</p>

<p>â€œGraingerâ€™s accordion with Summerhayesâ€™s fiddle is especially beautifulâ€ (Songlines).
Adam Summerhayes has been described as a â€œPaganini of the traditional violinâ€ (fRoots)</p>

<p>â€œI became utterly bewitched by the beauty of what Summerhayes and Grainger had created. It could justifiably be described as a folk symphony, possessing cyclical completeness yet creating a form that is, at once, both elemental and pastoral.â€ Fatea Magazine</p>
