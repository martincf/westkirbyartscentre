I"v<p>The Ciderhouse Rebellion is an exciting new duo bringing together two seasoned musicians: violinist Adam Summerhayes and master accordionist Murray Grainger.
The pair play traditional tunes, particularly from the North East, write their own music and specialise in creating within the moment – each performance is uniquely magical in its improvisatory focus.</p>

<p>During lock down they have been releasing weekly broadcasts on Facebook and YouTube – firstly The InCider Sessions and as lockdown eased a little The OutCider Sessions.</p>

<p>“Grainger’s accordion with Summerhayes’s fiddle is especially beautiful” (Songlines).
Adam Summerhayes has been described as a “Paganini of the traditional violin” (fRoots)</p>

<p>“I became utterly bewitched by the beauty of what Summerhayes and Grainger had created. It could justifiably be described as a folk symphony, possessing cyclical
completeness yet creating a form that is, at once, both elemental and pastoral.” Fatea Magazine</p>

<p>“A work of startling, immediate beauty” Folk Radio UK</p>
