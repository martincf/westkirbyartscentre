<p>“Sharp, original songs that dissect the modern world.
She captures both the harshness and enchantment of life” - Guardian</p>

<p>With a voice like spider-webbed hollows and lyrics that inspire and captivate, Martha has earned a
nomination from the BBC for best newcomer and released seven albums to date on her own label
 Squiggly Records building up a large audience worldwide.</p>

<p>Martha has played main stage spots at
 festivals including Glastonbury Acoustic stage, the Australian National Folk festival among others. She
 has toured with the likes of Damien Rice and she has also featured on the Zero 7 album ‘Yeah Ghost’.</p>

<p>Martha’s vibrant upbringing was both musical and artistic. In London with her artist mother and theatre
director stepfather, there was always late-night piano sessions, Joni Mitchell or Leonard Cohen
 spinning on the record player and creative chaos everywhere. But in Bristol her singer-songwriter
 father Steve Tilston and folk singer Maggie Boyle (step-mother) influenced her musical ear.</p>

<p>he would
 often find legendary musicians like Bert Jansch, John Renbourn gathered and singing in the family
kitchen. It was perhaps no wonder that all these textures fed into her creativity and emergence of
 Martha as a powerful songstress in her own right.</p>

<p>With her beautiful crystal clear vocals, Martha’s musical arrangements range from the pinhead
 intimacy of acoustic guitar and voice to the expansive electric, slide guitar, rolling beats, deep bass,
 banjo, string arrangements and sometimes touches of electronica.</p>

<p>The new album NOMAD will invite you to make a fire outside under the stars, Look up at a big green
 moon, fly over a world of robots and humans… and to never dwell on the path not taken.</p>
