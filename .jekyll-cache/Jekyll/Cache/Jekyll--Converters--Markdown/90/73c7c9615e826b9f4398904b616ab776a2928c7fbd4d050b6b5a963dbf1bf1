<p><strong>Legendary mountaineer Doug Scott gives a fascinating insight into how a lad born in
Nottingham during the darkest days of WWII got into climbing on the Black Rocks in
Derbyshire - aided with nothing but his motherâ€™s clothes line, and how this led him to
Everest in 1975.</strong></p>

<p>At dusk on 24 September, Doug and Dougal Haston became the first Britons to reach the
summit of Everest as lead climbers on Chris Boningtonâ€™s epic expedition to the mountainâ€™s
south-west face. As darkness fell they scraped a small cave in the snow 100 metres below
the summit and survived the highest bivouac ever - without bottled oxygen, sleeping bags
and, as it turned out, frostbite.</p>

<p>For Doug Scott, it was the fulfilment of a fortune-tellerâ€™s prophesy given to his mother:
that her eldest son would be in danger in a high place with the whole world watching.</p>

<p>Scott and Haston returned home national heroes with their image splashed across the front
pages. Scott went on to become one of Britainâ€™s greatest ever mountaineers, pioneering new
climbs in the remotest corners of the globe. His career spans the golden age of British
climbing from the 1960â€™s boom in outdoor adventure, to the new wave of lightweight alpinism
throughout the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p>Proceeds from the evening will support the work of Community Action Nepal
www.canepal.org.uk and include a sale of Nepalese goods and an auction of signed framed
mountaineering prints. Doug will show a short video about CAN and update the audience of
current projects in the remote region of North Gorkha. He will also be signing copies of
his posters and books.</p>
