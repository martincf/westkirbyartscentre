<p>Willy Porter has been turning first time listeners into die hard fans for more than two decades. Willy blurs the line between indie-folk and rock with his searing signature 
finger-picking guitar sound, absorbing lyrics, and playful, high-energy live performance style.</p>

<p>He has shared world stages with music icons Jeff Beck, Tori Amos, and Paul Simon, carving out a successful solo career as an artist who makes music that resonates long after 
the last guitar chord fades.</p>

<p>From the release of his breakthrough album, 1994â€™s Dog Eared Dream, to the launch of his own record label, Weasel Records, in 2005, Willy is an artist dedicated to delivering 
high-test, original musical experiences. His 2015 album, Human Kindness, featured the songs â€œTrainâ€ and â€œChippewa Boots,â€ performed live on NPRâ€™s A Prairie Home Companion by 
Willy and his singing/songwriting partner, Carmen Nickerson. The pair teamed up again in 2016 to make Bonfire to Ash, a record of co-writes produced by Grammy award-winner 
Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonathan Brooke).</p>

<p>Equally accomplished as a guitarist, singer, and songwriter, his songs weave a universal perspective about the questions, struggles, and triumphs of human existence. 
His live shows are guitar-driven eventsâ€“equal parts grit, soul, and muscleâ€“that are electrifying, dynamic, and wholly original in the way that Willyâ€™s voice blends 
and fuses with his galvanizing fret work.</p>

<p>Whether in the studio or on stage, Willy Porter gifts listeners with an unforgettable ride, embodying the very best of what live music has to offer.</p>

<p>â€œIf you need another flat-top guitar hero, look no further than Willy Porter, a blindingly fleet and maddeningly nimble player. 
If youâ€™re trying to get the hang of fingerstyle picking, youâ€™ll either curse the dude or forsake all and follow him.â€ â€“Riverfront Times</p>

<p>â€œI found Willy on iTunes six years ago. Went to see him live and joined the converted.â€œ

<p>â€œWilly Porter is perhaps best known as a down tuned six string wonder, but as a singer and a writer, and as a showman, he merits equal regard.â€œ
