I"ÿ<p>Performing his acclaimed new Album, Message From The Gods</p>

<p>Music set to the wonderful poetry of Maya Angelou, Pablo Neruda, Frida Kahlo, Kahlil Gibran, Kate Tempest, Leonard Cohen, Lorca and W H Auden</p>

<p>Released earlier this year, Keithâ€™s profound new Album has been met with huge enthusiasm from UK Radio Stations, the music press and followers across the country and will no doubt be considered to be his best collection yet. It continues to expose his unique skill of setting poetry to music and arriving at  stunningly beautiful results.
Each of these poems take on a new life as a song, they resonate deeply and instinctively and show the vital importance of personal connection, both on an intimate and universal level. Caged Bird - Maya Angelou and If you forget me - Pablo Neruda are stand out moments.</p>

<p>Keith is one of the most inventive and active performers in the UK and has had a noticeable presence for around 40 years, perfecting a highly individual style of writing, composition and performance. He is a superb guitarist with a unique and passionate style that caresses his captivating and emotional voice.</p>

<p>His lifetime study of Leonard Cohen has culminated in a remarkable ongoing tour of some 450 dates; playing to almost 150,000 people. Keith lives in Powys, Wales and AndalucÃ­a.</p>
