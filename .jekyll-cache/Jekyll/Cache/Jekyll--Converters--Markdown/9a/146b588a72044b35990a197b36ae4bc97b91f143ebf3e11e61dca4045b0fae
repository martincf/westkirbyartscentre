I"“<p>Wirral Poetry Festival brings you The Very Grimm Brothers.</p>

<p>Words &amp; music from The Very Grimm Brothers - Adrian Mealing + John Denton (gtr)  â€“  the only thing that cheers them up is you. Youâ€™re invited to their enchanted dark forest and encounters with direct action, clumsy departures, the poetry of platforms, marmalade, undimmed love and the spinning of gold from straw - described as â€˜middle-class rapâ€™ by William Coleman!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€˜Itâ€™s a very chatty, tangential gig. And Grimm John just bought a Martin D28 Re-imagined acoustic gtr. I donâ€™t know where he finds the moneyâ€™ complains Grimm Adrian.</p>
