I"p<p>The process of developing colour film can be a daunting prospect, but is actually fairly straightforward with the right guidance and equipment. Join our workshop to find out how to develop your own C41 (colour) film.</p>

<p>What to expect on the day</p>

<ul>
  <li>A class of up to two people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);</li>
  <li>lights are on all of the time! No darkroom darkness required. Youâ€™ll use a dark bag to load your film into a light-tight canister;</li>
  <li>a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected (I still ruin the odd roll of film from time to time);</li>
  <li>all chemicals, equipment, film sleeves will be provided; and access to a computer and scanner to scan your favourite shots from your roll;</li>
  <li>a sense of pride at having used science to create art.</li>
</ul>
