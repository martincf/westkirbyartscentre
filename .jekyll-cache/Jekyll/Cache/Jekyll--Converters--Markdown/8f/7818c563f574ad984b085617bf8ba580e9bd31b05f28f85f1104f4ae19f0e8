I"¬<p>Come and hear a pick of handwritten songs from Waxing Lyrical - the Wirral Singer/songwriter group based here at West Kirby Arts Centre.</p>

<p>You will hear piano, guitar, fiddle and mandolin players match their instrumental talents with fine lyrics and vocals.</p>

<p>Styles range from folk to country to contemporary to blues and back again! With both solo and group performances</p>

<p>The players are all local and several have already made recordings</p>

<p>The concert is being given in aid of Tyddn Mon - a residential centre for adults with learning difficulties supported by Mencap.</p>
