I"ô<p><strong>The easiest process within the world of darkroom processing is the task of developing black and white film. Mostly science with a touch of art (and a dash of luck), thereâ€™s nothing more exciting than developing your own roll of film.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect-on-the-day">What to expect on the day</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A class of up to three people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);</li>
  <li>lights are on all of the time! No darkroom darkness required. Youâ€™ll use a dark bag to load your film into a light-tight canister;</li>
  <li>a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected (I still ruin the odd roll of film from time to time);</li>
  <li>all chemicals, equipment, film sleeves will be provided; and access to a computer and scanner to scan your favourite shots from your roll;</li>
  <li>a sense of pride at having used science to create art.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-you-will-need">What you will need</h2>

<p>Just one thing, a finished roll of black and white 35mm film (24 or 36 exposures). You can buy black and white 35mm film locally from the <a href="https://openeye.org.uk">Open Eye Gallery</a> or <a href="http://www.wilkinson.co.uk/w/storelocation/liverpool/">Wilkinsons Cameras</a> in Liverpool, or buy it <a href="/posts/where-to-buy-film-uk.html">online here</a>. If youâ€™re really desperate, email me and I can sell a small amount from my own collection.</p>
