I"›	<p>We are very pleased to present Chris and Kellie While for what we expect to be a night to remember:</p>

<p>Chris who left The Albion Band in 1991 was described as â€œThe best singer in Englandâ€ by Eddi Reader.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œShe rises like an angel from the ashes with a voice to matchâ€ â€“Â The Guardian</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œShe has the heart of a poet and the eyes of a painter. Her writing is literate, credible, forthright and honest. Her voice is beautiful, a term I very rarely use when describing the deliveries of most singers. It is emotion packed without ever being melodramatic, compassionate without being needlessly sentimental, damning when she fervently believes certain issues need to be confronted head on, but always making for compelling listening. A quite superb album from one of the most notable women, currently living up to the reputation she has quite painstakingly built over a number of years in the contemporary folk scene.â€ â€“ Maverick Magazine (five stars)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œPeople will try to compare Chris Whileâ€™s voice to others but as Folk Roots wrote of her, â€œShe learns from many, takes from few and comes away her own woman, She is quite simply a skillful, powerful and beautiful singer/songwriter and superb guitarist at the top of her game.â€
â€‹
One the biggest joys in Chrisâ€™s life however is to sing with her Daughter â€¦..</p>
