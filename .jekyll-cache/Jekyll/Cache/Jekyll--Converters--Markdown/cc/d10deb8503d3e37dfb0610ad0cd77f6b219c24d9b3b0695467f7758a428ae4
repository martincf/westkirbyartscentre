I"Œ<p>One of Shakespeareâ€™s best-known tragedies, Macbeth is the tale of a heroic Scottish thane who encounters dark and mysterious prophecies made by a trio of witches, who predict his rise to power as king of Scotland. Spurred by what he believes to be his destiny and the sinister plotting of his ambitious wife, Macbeth gradually betrays his friends and abandons his humanity in the pursuit of fulfilling the prophecies.</p>

of murder, intrigue, war and treachery.</p>

<p>Greenroom is a branch of the Woolgatherers of Heswall for actors aged 30 and under, having run since 2015. With well-received self-written shows in â€˜The Ghost-Listenerâ€™ and â€˜Another Fine Messâ€™, as well as fresh takes on well-known plays such as â€˜Tartuffeâ€™ and â€˜4:48 Psychosisâ€™, this is our first opportunity to independently produce a Shakespeare play, to which we hope to bring a signature aesthetic and a gripping original style. We very much look forward to seeing you there!</p>
