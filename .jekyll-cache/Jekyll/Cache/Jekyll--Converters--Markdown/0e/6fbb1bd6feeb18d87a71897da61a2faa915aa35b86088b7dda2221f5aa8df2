I"Å<p>A double bill of unique musical biographies will premiere soon.</p>

<p>The first tells the story of one of Wirralâ€™s greatest but almost forgotten poets. Arthur Seymour John Tessimond was born in Claughton Village in 1902. The second part of the production takes Sylvia Plath as its subject. The Belfry is set in the final weeks of Plathâ€™s tragic life from the view point of her neighbour, a retired professor living in the flat below hers .</p>
