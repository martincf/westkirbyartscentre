I"<<p>Continuing the tradition set over the last two years, for the month of January, we are
handing the Arts Centre over to the ‘Friends of West Kirby Arts Centre’ to run a series of
concerts along with an exhibition featuring local talent and introducing some new up and
coming artists and performers.</p>

<p>Please come along and support the Friends and the bands, each concert is just £5.00 and any
surplus income will go to support the Friends Fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>The venue is situated in Brookfield Gardens on the site of the old Unitarian Church. Access from the street is via a flight of steps with, currently, no ramped access for wheelchairs. Park for free after 6.30pm at West Kirby Concourse, only 4 minutes walk away, as there is no on street parking available at the venue. Licensed bar available.</p>
