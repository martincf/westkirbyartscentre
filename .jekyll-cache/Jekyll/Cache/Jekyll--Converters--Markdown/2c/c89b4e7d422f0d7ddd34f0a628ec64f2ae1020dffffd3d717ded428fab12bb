I"|<p>As part of Wirral International Guitar Festival 2019 we welcome Chris Woods Groove Orchestra</p>

<p>When Google book an artists for their event, someone described as ‘changing the perceived boundaries of the acoustic guitar’, you know you aren’t talking about your average musician.</p>

<p>An instrumental phenomenon, Chris is appearing as ‘The Chris Woods Groove Orchestra’ where he blends ear bending dropped tuned grooves with endearing stories to create his performances. There is an eerie feel to his music; a dark jazz texture driven by explosive guitar percussion…..</p>

<p>A guitarist, composer, performer, producer, and an educator. Touring across the globe appearing at festivals including Glastonbury Festival (UK) across to  the likes of the Mikulášsky Jazz festival in Slovakia, with performances in art houses, theatres and even prestigious shows such as the NAMM show in LA. His mind bending guitar approach is exceptional.</p>

<p>In February 2019 Chris is launching his new album so come and catch his latest ‘one man orchestra of epic proportions, taking you on a journey from minimalist solo guitar to looped cinematic sounds and explosive six string explorations.Paul Costello.</p>
