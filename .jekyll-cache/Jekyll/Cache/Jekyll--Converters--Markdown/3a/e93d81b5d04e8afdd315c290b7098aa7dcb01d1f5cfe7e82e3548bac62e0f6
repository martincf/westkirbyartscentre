I"é<p>The Freedom Concert is the concept of Chris and Lynne Strange. Both were
heavily involved in musical theatre some years ago but for the past three years
have become strongly connected with the local Wirral acoustic music scene.</p>

<p>With our gradual return to â€˜normalcyâ€™ following the Covid 19 Pandemic,
Chris wanted to use three of the best acoustic acts on the Wirral, who help
sum up the music scene, for a celebration night to acknowledge our regaining
of â€˜freedomâ€™.</p>

<p>Act 1 is VOCAL POINT - a well established trio on the Wirral folk scene. They
are, Sue Farley, Angela and John Owen. Sue is Johnâ€™s sister and Angela, his wife.
Sue and John play guitar and have beautiful voices. Angela provides various percussion
and majors on bodhran, the Irish drum and often brags that she was taught by an expert ~
Stephan Hannigan.</p>

<p>Their music library contains many traditional and contemporary folk songs, some
self-penned, together with the occasional rendition of a country song or two. A capella
singing is another of their specialities which dovetails nicely with their ability to perform
wonderful wistful ballads and rhythmic songs that will have your feet tapping in no time.
Sue was for many years the Musical Director of the Knowsley Singers and John has
musical experience on stage from his time with the Wirral Theatre Company. Angela and
John are also the organisers of the excellent Hungry Horse Folk Club in Ellesmere Port,
located at The Whitby Club and the Wirral Folk Festival, held at the same venue each
June.</p>

<h3 id="act-2-is-split-level---an-acoustic-duo">Act 2 is SPLIT LEVEL - an acoustic duo.</h3>
<p>Phil Chisnall and Lynne Strange deliver a
wide, eclectic variety of cover songs in various genres, as well as Philâ€™s own critically
acclaimed self written compositions. Together, Lynne and Phil, as Split Level, have been
delighting audiences for the past two years.</p>

<p>Phil has a strong musical history, having been involved in performing music since the
early eighties. He has worked in various band, duo and solo formats and performed in
different music venues, clubs and festivals throughout the country Phil is a highly
accomplished acoustic guitar player, using different tunings and styles including slide
guitar. He is known particularly for his own song writing. Philâ€™s strong voice has drawn
favourable comparisons to the likes of Eric Clapton, Elvis Costello and Gordon Haskell.
Lynne Strange has a broad experience in musical theatre, with a beautiful voice, drawing
comparisons to Annie Lennox, that perfectly blends with Philâ€™s. Her stage performance of
the songs she sings, captivates any audience. Lynne and Philâ€™s different music
backgrounds help compliment each other and make for a unique duo.</p>

<p>Following the untimely passing of one of her idols â€“ Tom Petty â€“ Emma Owen, co
organiser of The Summer Strum music festival was inspired to put together a

over the years. The band enjoyed playing the promos and had a blast so decided to
carry on and develop the concept.</p>
