I"Y<p>Wirral Poetry Festival brings you The Very Grimm Brothers.</p>

<p>Words &amp; music from The Very Grimm Brothers - Adrian Mealing + John Denton (gtr)  –  the only thing that cheers them up is you. You’re invited to their enchanted dark forest and encounters with direct action, clumsy departures, the poetry of platforms, marmalade, undimmed love and the spinning of gold from straw - described as ‘middle-class rap’ by William Coleman!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘It’s a very chatty, tangential gig. And Grimm John just bought a Martin D28 Re-imagined acoustic gtr. I don’t know where he finds the money’ complains Grimm Adrian.</p>
