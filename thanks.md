## Thanks!

**A big thank you for your purchase!**

### Ticket purchase – collecting your tickets

Please note, we do not issue tickets. Tickets are collected at the door on the night of the event. Please keep the Worldpay receipt for your records as proof of purchase.

We're really looking forward to seeing you soon. Please make sure you arrive early enough to get comfortable and buy a drink at our licensed bar. For directions to the arts centre, you can read the Visiting details below.

### CD purchase

If you purchased a CD, it will posted to you in due course.
