**The Wilfred Owen Story is the UK's first and only permanent exhibition dedicated to the iconic WW1 poet. The museum was established in 2011 and celebrates Wilfred Owen's formative years spent on the Wirral.**

On display are many unique items that have attracted visitors from all over the world. Exhibits include a letter from Wilfred's mother Susan addressed to her godchild in Birkenhead after the Owens had left the area. Further investigation discovered that the little girl Susie was of German descent. This astonishing fact was the subject of a BBC documentary.

Other family letters feature in the exhibition alongside artifacts from WW1, including a replica of Owen's lieutenant uniform and his Military cross medal (the original was stolen some years ago).

Another fascinating piece of memorabilia is a tea spoon believed to have been used by the poet himself while serving in the Artist's Rifles regiment.  

Owen, was educated at the Birkenhead Institute (a replica and full archive of the school feature within the exhibition), he spent summer holidays at his Auntie and Uncle’s home in Bertram Drive in nearby Meols.

'It is really lovely here' he wrote in one letter. 'There are miles of fields in front of the house and it is not far from the sea.'' In other letters, he speaks of going ‘on the lake’ at West Kirby. Most poignantly, it was the decision of his relatives not to assist in funding Wilfred’s entry into university that ultimately led to Wilfred's decision to join up and enlist in World War One.

Since opening the WOS has received hundreds of visitors a year from all over the UK and abroad. Its new situation here in West Kirby has the potential to host large groups, and expand with seminars, workshops and writing retreats.
