## Local band Coast have now released their long awaited debut album _After All This time_.

The twelve tracks cover their local and distant adventures over the past two years and there are firm favourites as well as some fabulous new songs to listen to. Asked about their influences and their music's genre, the band (David Cotton, Elizabeth Fitzsimons, Bob Glass & Clive Glass) said - 'undefinable!'.

There's contemporary folk, country, some love songs and a bit of pop! You can buy the CD version of the album here for just Â£12 (including post & packaging). Sure - why wouldn't you!?
